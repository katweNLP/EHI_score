Heavy price Some Italian workers have already been out protesting. In Rome, workers at the Italian Institute for the Professional Development of Vocational Training of Workers (Isfol) held protests against the cuts at their headquarters. One worker, Simone Casadei, said the public sector had already paid a heavy price. \"The sector of public research has already paid its toll and suffered cuts in the past,\" he said. \"So we are asking for our sector to be left out of the new budget cuts.\" He added that the money should be raised by getting tough on tax evasion. \"We also demand that the money needed to face this problems... is obtained through a tough action against tax evasion. \"The state cannot always take the money from the same sources, that is workers and pensioners.\" The government hopes to bring its deficit down to below 3% of GDP by 2012 - from 5.3% now - in order to help maintain the confidence of international investors and prevent the spread of a Greek-style debt crisis.

Nordea Bank's Sasja Beslik told the BBC the protests were \"just the beginning\". People who were worried about climate change did not feel that had many other \"tools\" at their disposal, he said. Mr Beslik is in charge of sustainable finance at Nordea, one of the biggest banks in Europe, and the third largest corporation in the Nordic region of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The fund Mr Beslik manages stopped investing in VW after the emissions scandal and no longer authorises the buying of Facebook stock because of concerns over how the company has been addressing its data privacy issues. Speaking to 5 Live's Wake up to Money, he said: \"I think this [this week's wave of protests] is just the beginning. If we talk about the number of millennials in Europe and in countries all over the world, they are very concerned about the situation and I don't think they feel that they have too many other tools in their hands to approach this.\" He said the key to forcing companies to change lay not just with grassroots protest, but in the boardroom, because the world's financial sector was \"the biggest global tool at the table\". \"I think it is fairly obvious that the actions taken by politicians and businesses around the world are not enough,\" he said, adding: \"87% of all the capital in the world is not managed in a way that takes into account climate issues… If we want to employ the big muscles in the world when it comes to changing the industries… you need to deploy financial capital.\" 'Public statement' Earlier this week, Legal & General Investment, which manages £1tn worth of UK pension fund investments, said it was putting climate change at the top of its list of concerns when looking into how companies are run. Sonja Laud, deputy chief investment officer at Legal & General Investment Management, said it was important that investors pushed for change. \"We've seen a lot more engagement especially when we started with this very public statement that we would actually name those where we feel there is not sufficient progress on a corporate level,\" she added. \"There is no individual sector where we would say straight away that we would divest because to us it is all about the engagement and making sure we get the company in line with what we would like to achieve.\"",

		"InputText": "\"My business is to fly,\" says 40-year-old Kiev resident Ruslan Gritsaylo, who really does look like a man who loves his job. Every week he takes customers up in the air on his tiny aircraft known as a paratrike. A cousin of the microlight, paratrikes look like a tricycle tractor with a huge propeller mounted behind, as well as a big parachute which rises into the sky on take-off. At first sight it may be difficult to believe that this vehicle can make it into the air, but these doubts quickly eat the dust when the vehicle breaks away from the earth. Piloting in the blood Mr Gritsaylo is a third generation pilot. His grandfather flew during World War II, and his father was a pilot in the 1970s. He himself flew sports aircraft and was trained as civil aviation pilot. When the Soviet Union ceased to exist, he realised he could make good money by piloting flights on his own. \"My dear wife Aliona is joking with me: your hobby became a business, and then your business became a hobby. It's all about love,\" says Mr Gritsaylo. When he started his business in the 1990s, there was not much competition. There was not enough information about paratrikes - how to construct them or how to fly them safely - so it was a rather dangerous business. This changed over time as the technology improved, making flights on the micro-vehicles completely safe and civilised, according to Mr Gritsaylo. \"It still can be considered as an extreme sport, but it is more about endorphin then adrenalin,\" he says. \"It's more about enjoying it rather than being scared of it. The definition of paratrike is one of the safest flying machines ever created by man.\" Between the lines of the law In a country well-known for its love of red tape, securing permits to fly paratrikes proved complicated. Mr Gritsaylo found that many laws in the aviation sphere contradicted each other, and it was very difficult to properly legalise the business for a small private company. \"There are lots of things, which make no sense. \"For example, people come and ask, show me your papers. I say, what kind of papers? and they say, well your pilot licence. \"I have six pilot licences all over the world, but I don't have Ukrainian, because there is no company legally providing official pilot licences for this kind of ultra-light flying machine,\" he says. So his biggest problem became his biggest opportunity: because of imperfect legislation his aircraft does not require registration. Otherwise, he would have had to get 11 different permits, which would have been almost impossible. \"It's a balance between 'yes' and 'no' - it's 'maybe'. And between the borders of this 'maybe', you can do everything. We are between the lines of the law.\" Mr Gritsaylo carries several thousand customers every year. They stand in line to fly during weekends. Ten minutes in the sky costs about $60 (£37) - for Ukraine, that is quite a lot of money, but he spreads his net wide to catch customers by using social media and maintaining his own website. \"I follow the rule of big figures - you make lots of calls, lots of e-mails, lots of people. Lots of money,\" says Mr Gritsaylo, whose phone rings almost every five minutes. AirForia euphoria His clients are made up of a wide range of people - bankers, office managers, artists, actors - and often people buy certificates to fly as gifts for each other. People get their biggest kick from night-flights, otherwise known as open-space flights. Mr Gritsaylo likes to call himself The Man who Brings Happiness. He even named his aero club AirForia, a play on euphoria. He says that after he started taking people up into the sky he needed to diversify his business model, and now he advertises insurance companies and other companies on his parachutes, flying their banners through the skies and performing paratrike tricks during airshows. \"Take a bottle of milk. How can you earn money with a bottle of milk? Advertise it with an airplane! Where, when, with whom - these are the questions. But every question has an answer. You have to find the connection between the airplane and something you see around\". Mr Gritsaylo also purchased equipment so he could produce high-quality videos of the flights. He sets the camera right on the nose of his aircraft and claims that he can take better pictures than helicopters can. \"Every year you must make some step forward, because there are lots of people walking behind you. And they are trying to step on your toes. If you don't go forward - they will walk on top of you,\" says Mr Gritsaylo, with a huge smile on his face.",

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Friday it would probe the sale of 30 million policies worth £150bn. It will examine how the news leaked, hitting shares in insurance firms. The inquiry will look at pensions, endowments, investment bonds and life assurance policies sold in the UK between the 1970s and 2000. The FCA had been due to announce the probe in its annual business plan on Monday, but details were revealed ahead of schedule by The Daily Telegraph. Otto Thoreson, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said the story had caused \"absolute confusion in the investment markets\". Mr Tyrie said: \"On the face of it, this is an extraordinary blunder. \"It is crucial that we have a full and transparent explanation about how such an apparently serious mistake came to be made by our financial services watchdog - the body appointed by Parliament to enforce high standards of conduct. \"The principle that market sensitive information is released accurately to all participants at the same time appears to have been breached.\" 'Uncertainty' Mr Thoreson told the BBC: \"What happened was effectively a pre-briefing of a business plan which is going to be published on Monday.\" \"But because it was to one newspaper, and it was written up as a story without the ability of those of us who are involved in the industry to corroborate issues, what you saw was the uncertainty that was created causing absolute confusion in the investment markets.\" Later on Friday the FCA issued a statement in response to concerns about how it had handled the release of the news about its investigation. \"The Board will conduct an investigation into the FCA's handling of the issue involving an external law firm, and will share the outcome of this work in due course,\" it said. Legal & General, Aviva and Resolution - which owns Friends Provident - were among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, just days after share prices were hit by George Osborne's plans for an overhaul of the UK's pension system and a cap on pension management fees. 'Zombie' funds Formally announcing the inquiry into old policies on Friday, the FCA said it was concerned that some companies were not giving the same priority to policies sold years ago as they did to new policies. A large number of policies sold to consumers in the 30 years to 2000 include terms that penalise those attempting to switch to a cheaper provider. Some savers face losing up to half of their savings if they move to another company. The FCA also said it feared \"zombie\" funds, which are closed to new clients, were being used by insurers to pay bills from other parts of their businesses. Details of the inquiry will be officially published on Monday. But concerns that will be covered include: The financial services industry has been scarred by several high-profile scandals during the past few decades involving the mis-selling of policies such as mortgage endowments, personal pensions and payment protection insurance. Millions of endowment policies were sold in the 1980s and 1990s, typically as a method of repaying mortgages, often with unsubstantiated claims that they were guaranteed to pay off the customers' home loan. Millions of pounds were subsequently paid in compensation.",

If you had two major pieces of work to do each year, you would not decide to do one in December and one in March, but that's what the OBR has to do. In its report accompanying the Budget it complained that its already tight timetable had been made harder by government departments handing in their homework at the last minute. \"We were not given details of costings for a large proportion of significant policy measures until just before our deadlines,\" the report said. Now, this ranks as a relatively minor whinge, but the gloves came off for the complaints in the OBR's news conference. The trouble is, the OBR has to make forecasts based on how much it thinks the government is going to spend in years for which there are not yet detailed departmental spending plans, which currently applies to the period after April 2016. 'Complex and opaque' It does this based on what's called the medium term spending assumption. And OBR chairman Robert Chote is not best pleased about it. \"Back in 2011 we could explain the government's spending assumption in our EFO [economic and fiscal outlook] in just 29 words,\" he told reporters. Users of the BBC News app tap here for the Budget Calculator. \"It has now become so complicated that it requires 428 words.\" If you read through it, it is pretty difficult to get your head round, with lots of detail about whether or not it is taking into account the \"life-length of roads\" and \"depreciation for Network Rail\". And the problem is that what the government puts in its spending assumption is really important. At the moment, we only have detailed spending plans for the first year of the next parliament. We're relying on the spending assumption to work out spending in the other four. \"It's unfortunate that this assumption has become so complex and opaque because in an era of fiscally neutral Budget and Autumn Statement scorecards it's become the main mechanism by which the government achieves the outcomes for the Budget balance that it wants to see across the forecast,\" Robert Chote said. The OBR report shows that the impact of changes to Budget measures are absolutely dwarfed by the effect of changes to the spending assumption. In other words, most of the movements in the forecast come from a complicated set of assumptions for years in which there are no proper spending plans. And to have the head of the OBR condemning parts of the process as \"opaque\" is a real problem for the government, which created the OBR to become more transparent and prevent governments from fiddling the figures.",

		"InputText": "Kamal AhmedEconomics editor@bbckamalon Twitter Another upgrade like today's and the Bank of England will be more positive than it was about the British economy in May last year - its final Inflation Report before the referendum. At that point it forecast growth for 2016 would be 2% (which turned out to be right), rising to 2.3% for 2017 and staying there for 2018. It assumed that Britain would remain in the EU as that was official government policy. Then came the referendum, Brexit and the Bank's August Inflation Report - which will go down in history as the point of maximum exit fear at Threadneedle Street, the Gloomflation Report. The Bank slashed growth projections to 0.8% for 2017 and 1.8% for 2018, a huge downgrade which would have resulted - if the forecasts came to pass - in an economy billions of pounds smaller than previously projected. Substantial Since then, Mark Carney and the members of the Monetary Policy Committee have become much more chipper. In November, the Bank upgraded its growth forecasts by 0.6% for 2017, one of the most substantial increases it has ever published. Today that tone has continued, another substantial upgrade for this year and - as importantly - a small upgrade for next year which many believe will be the moment any negative Brexit effects actually start to crystallise as Britain enters the hard yards of the exit process. Does that mean the Brexit effect has disappeared? Not according to the Bank. It still believes - even with these substantial upgrades - that by 2019 the UK economy will be 1.5% smaller than it would have been had Britain voted to stay in the EU. And with a total gross domestic product of around £2 trllion, that's still a substantial sum. Though it should be pointed out that the figure is significantly better than the 2.5% it judged the gap would be last November. Dove The Bank still has plenty of warning lights flashing on the dashboard. Business investment is expected to fall. And the decline in the value of sterling has boosted inflation, with the Bank warning today that wage growth is likely to stall and consumer consumption - one of the key drivers of economic growth - slow. Interestingly, though, the Bank has become a little more doveish on the inflation issue as the pound has strengthened slightly over the last two months. And as the major retailers battle over market share, food prices are actually falling, not rising. Though the same cannot be said of fuel and input prices - that's the costs businesses pay for the products they use - which are both rising rapidly. Help Why has the Bank become much more bullish on the economy? First, the effects of stimulus measures taken after the referendum are starting to feed through. The Bank and the government have taken broadly expansionary policy positions over the last six months. The Bank has cut interest rates and provided more financial support - quantitative easing - for banks and businesses. Phillip Hammond's Autumn Statement relaxed deficit reduction targets and laid out plans to boost infrastructure spending. Beyond that, consumer confidence has remained robust as low interest rates have supported credit expansion and spending. That has maintained demand, which is good for an economy dominated by the services sector. With inflation rising, the Bank has become slightly more hawkish on the possibility of an interest rate rise this year or next. Which would be welcomed by many savers, if not mortgage holders. Trump Jump Second, Britain does not live in a Brexit bubble. The global economy is becoming stronger. Far from a Trump Dump, there has been a Trump Jump with businesses predicting that presidential promises of a fiscal stimulus to support infrastructure investment and tax cuts for individuals and firms will boost growth. The rest of Europe is also posting some better economic growth figures. Both have a positive effect on the UK economy, an exporting nation which is enjoying the fruits of a weaker currency. The Bank insists there is still a Brexit effect on the downside - and the Governor will be braced for more criticisms that the August report was simply too negative. Yes, the Bank is more chipper. But, it is still wary about the future.",

		"InputText": "By Simon AtkinsonBBC Business Reporter But many analysts are already saying that if Mr Macron fails to deliver on economic promises over the next five years, then the challenge from the National Front could be even stiffer come the 2022 election. As a former economy minister to outgoing president Francois Hollande, his economic credentials formed a big part of his campaign. So what are some of his key economic policies? Reforming the eurozone The election result briefly sent the euro to a six-month high against the dollar, as markets reacted to the victory by the pro-EU candidate. Ms Le Pen had campaigned for France to leave the euro and proposed a referendum in which French voters would have an opportunity to vote to leave the EU. Mr Macron wants France to stay in the eurozone, but reform it. In his manifesto, he wanted a common eurozone budget and a eurozone finance minister too. He also will ask Berlin to invest and spend more to help Germany's domestic economy, which it is hoped will help French exporters and manufacturers in other European countries. But all of this can only happen with Germany's backing. There'll be no decisions until after Germany's elections later this year, so for now he can only focus on domestic policy. Help business While Francois Hollande initially tried to please the socialist elements of his party by being tough on companies, Mr Macron as economy minister oversaw a change in direction over the past three years, heralding a more pro-business approach. That included about 40bn euros ($44bn; £33.9bn) in tax breaks to try to invigorate the economy, a benefit Mr Macron plans to make permanent. He also says corporation tax will gradually reduce from 33% to 25%. And a new wealth tax, aimed at the rich, will not apply to financial investments. Tackle unemployment The unemployment rate in France is 10.1%. About three million people who want to work and are looking for a job don't have one. While not the worst figures in Europe, it is above average for the region and far worse than, for example, the Netherlands, where it is just above 5%, and Germany, where it is below 4%. The figure for the UK is below 5%. Youth unemployment is particularly bad, with about one in four under-25s out of work. Mr Macron has said he hopes to get unemployment down by thinning some of the labour laws, with an aim of making it less onerous on employers to take on new staff. The International Monetary Fund estimates that it will be hard to get French unemployment down much below 8.5% without major reform. But one thing in the President-elect's favour is that the strongest union in the private sector is now the moderate CFDT, which now has more clout than the more militant CGT. Mr Macron has no plans to scrap France's controversial 35-hour working week - a rule which doesn't ban long hours, but is a threshold which triggers overtime payment. Instead he has said he'll allow firms to negotiate deals with their staff on hours and pay. And perhaps another sign of hope. The economy has been creating jobs at the fastest pace in more than a decade. Read more: Budget targets The European Union requires members to make sure their budget deficit (essentially the difference between what it brings in through revenues e.g. tax and what it spends) is no more than 3% of gross domestic product. France has missed this target - at times dramatically - in recent years as the Hollande government resisted pressure to bring in swingeing austerity measures. Mr Macron says that as economy minister he was working towards hitting that target, and estimates it'll happen this year. Slim down the state France has one of the largest public sectors in the world. Public spending last year was 56.5% of GDP. And with plans to reduce corporation tax, cutting that spending bill becomes more urgent. Mr Macron believes he can save 60bn euros over five years. This is not hugely radical, for example election rival Francois Fillon had proposed 100bn euros of spending cuts. One concrete measure we know about is plans to cut about 120,000 government jobs by not replacing civil servants when they retire. However, he also wants to make unemployment benefits available to groups currently not eligible, including the self-employed, entrepreneurs and farmers. And while other European countries look to force people to work longer before being entitled to state pensions, France's official retirement age of 62 will be unchanged. The president-elect does, however, have plans to overhaul the system to make pension payouts more closely tied to what individuals pay in.",

Does that make sense?\" For many Americans, the answer is, basically, yes. The president \"should have worded that better\", said Michael Washington 42, of Brooklyn, an assistant manager at a messenger service in New York. Mr Washington said he disliked the implication that poor people are stupid. But, he added, \"it makes sense to hire someone rich because they're business-minded. I would agree with that\". American attitudes toward the poor have shown signs of improving. About two-thirds of Americans think the poor are hard-working, up from half in 1985, according to a 2016 survey conducted for the Los Angeles Times. And about 55% of Americans believe the poor and non-poor have job skills that are \"pretty much the same\", up from 44% in 1985. Caitlin Quigley, 27, who works at a charity in New York, said Mr Trump's conflation of wealth with talent rankled. \"Just because a person's rich doesn't say anything about their capabilities or qualifications or how they'd help us and represent us,\" she said. But Mr Trump's belief that success and talent can be measured in dollars has a long tradition in American life, particularly among conservatives, said historian Nancy Isenberg, a professor at Louisiana State University and the author of White Trash: The 400-year Untold History of Class in America. \"The truth is that this is something that Americans are quite comfortable with,\" she said. \"We talk about equality but we're quite comfortable with class hierarchy.\" Up by your bootstraps Even with evidence that social mobility is falling, the up-from-your-bootstraps belief that wealth is a sign of merit holds strong in the US. In a 2014 survey by Pew Research Center, about 57% of Americans disagreed with the idea that success is determined by outside forces. That was a higher percentage than in almost any other country of 44 included (in the UK that percentage was 55%). In the same survey, nearly three-quarters of Americans said it is important to work hard to get ahead in life (that percentage was 60% in the UK). Mr Trump has \"an obscure way of saying things\", but he also has a point, said George Paragon, 46, of Yonkers, who works in human services. \"We wouldn't want a shoemaker to fly a plane,\" he said. Empathy gap? Susana Navas, 64, of the Bronx, a financial supervisor, said she sees risks in plucking policymakers from the ranks of the mega-rich. \"They don't know much about the people's economy,\" she said. \"They know about being rich.\" Studies suggest that the rich pay less attention to others and have less empathy. They've also been found to be more likely to ascribe identity and status to inherent traits. Indeed, Professor Isenberg said the president's proposals - which include tax cuts for the rich and a reduction of health assistance for the poor - are more telling about his attitudes to poverty than Wednesday's remarks. \"The healthcare bill has a lot more to say about his disregard for the poor and indifference than this comment,\" she said.",

The ECB also kept the key interest rate for the countries that use the euro currency unchanged at 0%. Mr Draghi said: \"After a long time we are finally experiencing a robust recovery, where we only have to wait for wages and prices to follow a course towards our objective. \"The last thing the governing council wants is an unwanted tightening and for conditions that may either slow down this process or even jeopardise it.\" Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"The comment on inflation which is sticking in our head is Mr Draghi's notice to markets that: 'We are not there yet.'\" 'Super-sensitive' markets However, the euro did move sharply to a 14-month high against the dollar when at one point Mr Draghi hinted that the governing council of the ECB might start discussing reducing QE in the autumn. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital commented: \"It wasn't much but the market is super-sensitive to anything from Draghi at the moment.\" Last month, Mr Draghi's speech in Sintra in Portugal was interpreted by many economists as meaning the eurozone's economic recovery would allow QE to end and for interest rates to rise. Patrick O'Donnell, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: \"This is a well-choreographed attempt by Mr Draghi to make sure that financial markets don't get ahead of themselves after his more hawkish comments of late.\" The QE bond-buying programme, together with ultra-low interest rates, was designed to encourage lending and fend off the threat of deflation in the eurozone. Mr Draghi said the policy had been a success: \"We have created in the last three years six million jobs, much more than any time before the crisis in the same amount of time. \"All the economic sentiment indicators and survey indicators are either at all time highs or close to them so the policies have been successful.\" Subdued inflation However, the inflation rate in the eurozone was 1.3% in June, down slightly from 1.4% in May, some way below the ECB's target of close to, but below, 2%. Mr Draghi said: \"Measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, are still subdued. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term.\" Aberdeen Asset Management's Mr O'Donnell said: \"We probably won't hear anything significant out of the ECB until September, which is plenty of time for investors to digest Mr Draghi's caveat laden hawkishness. \"Mr Draghi will be hoping that today's performance is enough to give him a quiet summer.\"",

Co-chairman Guilherme Leal told the BBC it would remain committed to the firm's principles on ingredients and testing. \"We are much more similar to The Body Shop than L'Oreal,\" Mr Leal said. \"I respect L'Oreal, but they are a huge corporation,\" he added. The Body Shop, founded by the late Dame Anita in 1976, was a pioneer in using natural ingredients for its beauty products. Mr Leal said: \"Natura is a company that was born in the same way of The Body Shop almost at the same time. \"And we have this connection with sustainability, with ingredients from the Amazon, and we need a platform to go abroad.\" Natura started in 1969 and has since grown into one of Latin America's biggest cosmetics groups. Its success is based on a vast network of sales consultants and a culture of using local communities to source ingredients from the Amazon in a sustainable way. The acquisition was announced in June and concluded last week. The deal turns Natura into a global player, buying The Body Shop's 3,200 shops in 66 countries and 18,000 workers. In 2013, it also purchased Australian group Aesop. L'Oreal bought The Body Shop from its original owners back in 2006, when the company was at its height. But recently the brand has seen a drop in sales, with other competitors increasing their market share. 'Protect the Amazon' Mr Leal told the BBC the deal is also a strategy for Natura to reduce its risks, as most of its sales are done in Latin America, where many countries have recently experienced recession, particularly Brazil. By expanding its operations to Europe the group will be less exposed to the problems of the Brazilian economy. The co-chairman of Natura also criticised Brazil for its mismanagement of resources in the Amazon, saying the country is not wisely using its natural wealth. Brazil's President Michel Temer recently issued a decree to open up parts of the forest to mining activities. The decision has been suspended and is under review, after public outcry against the measure. Mr Leal, who ran for vice-president of Brazil in 2010 as part of the Green Party, said the country should reconsider its economic activities in the rainforest. \"I don't think the Amazon is a place to do agriculture.

		"InputText": "Vivergo Fuels said there was \"no guarantee\" production would recommence at the Hull facility. It said losses had risen due to government delays in making oil companies use 10% bioethanol in petrol. The Department for Transport said it was \"on track\" to double the biofuels supply by 2020. Bioethanol is a renewable transport fuel which is blended with petrol to cut carbon emissions. It is made from organic matter including sugar, maize or, in the case of Vivergo, wheat. Vivergo's managing director, Mark Chesworth, told the BBC's Today programme that thousands of people could be affected by the stoppage: \"For 150 skilled workers on the banks of the Humber and the 3,000 people we support across the supply chain, many of them UK farmers, it's a very worrying time for the business.\" Petrol sold in the UK contains about 5% bioethanol, which Vivergo says results in carbon emissions savings equivalent to taking 180,000 cars off the road. Vivergo has called on the government to increase the amount of bioethanol in petrol to 10% by introducing a fuel called E10. The company - part of Associated British Foods - said that would mean emissions savings equivalent to taking 700,000 cars off the road. It said it had invested heavily in its Hull plant in the expectation ministers would introduce new rules forcing oil companies to increase the percentage of bioethanol in petrol. However, it said the delay in imposing that rule had meant that Vivergo's losses had increased, meaning it made \"more sense\" to stop production. Mr Chesworth said there had been too much political instability to bring the new rules in: \"There's been a series of delays in progressing that policy. Two general elections in the last two years, the EU referendum, four transport secretaries in the last four years - none of that helps to progress the policy.\" The company plans to carry out annual maintenance during the shutdown to \"maintain employment levels\". Vivergo employs 150 people, split between its plant in Hull and head office in Hessle, East Yorkshire. 'On track' In September, the Department for Transport said it would increase the use of renewable fuels in petrol and diesels from 4.75% to 9.75% by 2020 - known as the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation. \"This will double the use of renewable fuels, reduce our reliance on imported fossil diesel, and deliver emissions savings equal to taking another one million cars off the road,\" it said. \"We are working closely with the industry and motoring groups to consider the issues around a potential introduction of E10 and the role government can play in this.\" Vivergo said it had welcomed the government's proposals to increase the use of renewable fuels, but \"remained concerned that there is no roll-out framework for E10 in the UK, the absence of which could have serious consequences for the long-term future of the UK bioethanol industry\". Mr Chesworth added: \"If the government does not increase the blend level to 9.75% and actively support the introduction of E10, the industry will be left in an unsustainable situation with excess capacity and there are likely to be casualties. \"I am not predicting that we will be one of them but with an unclear restart date, it is clearly concerning for all involved with Vivergo Fuels.\"",

He said that regulatory alignment with the EU was the biggest concern for the industry in the short term. At the moment, UK-made parts for planes are certified by a European body. UK manufacturing is currently covered by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). But if the country leaves the EU without a deal, then from 30 March next year UK aircraft components would not be covered - either in the EU or in other countries such as the US and China. This would mean that without recognised safety certificates any aircraft using those parts could be grounded. \"That is the extreme case\", said Mr Everitt, \"but it's not scare-mongering [to say that] aircraft will not fly.\" His comments come as carmaker Jaguar Land Rover warned that a \"bad\" Brexit deal would threaten £80bn worth of investment plans for the UK and may force it to close factories. A spokesman for Theresa May said that the Prime Minister was aware of the views of business, and a forthcoming white paper policy document would give more details on the proposed relationship between the UK and EU. \"The PM has been very clear that we take the views of business seriously and we also know the importance of providing certainty as we leave the EU,\" the spokesman said. He said it was vital that UK regulatory agencies began drawing up contingency plans with EASA. In a letter last month to the European Commission, ADS said that \"EASA and the CAA [the UK's Civil Aviation Authority] need to urgently begin technical and contingency planning.... separate to the political negotiations.\" However, so far the European Commission has refused to allow any technical discussions between UK and EU aviation authorities. Any such talks could take up to nine months to avoid potential pitfalls come March 2019, meaning they need to start almost immediately, \"otherwise they are not going to happen in time,\" said ADS chief economist Jeegar Kakkad. ADS argues that the UK aerospace industry - which generated £35bn in turnover and accounted for £30bn in exports last year - needs regulatory alignment with the EU and continued membership of EASA. The industry body wants the UK to remain part of the EU's customs union in order to maintain frictionless borders. Under the government's current border proposals, the ADS estimates that once the UK leaves the EU costs for the industry could rise by £2.3bn a year. \"From an industrial point of view, we see the potential for serious disruption and costs which will make [all of] Europe less competitive,\" said Mr Everitt. A number of big businesses including Airbus, BMW, Siemens and Jaguar Land Rover, have recently issued similar calls for clarity on Brexit, and warned that without a deal investment in the UK could suffer.",

Speaking to the BBC Mr Allan said it was \"astonishing\" that 27 European countries could agree a \"lot more readily\" than UK politicians.

Mr Allan, who is also chairman of Tesco and house builder Barrett, said the CBI did not have a position on a second or confirmatory referendum. \"But my personal view is if the politicians can't get their act together and get to an agreement the only other option is to go back to the people and have a second referendum to see whether people still feel the same way now that they did almost three years ago and resolve it that way. \"One way or the other we have just got to break out of this impasse that we've got at the moment and get agreement. In a thinly veiled warning to MPs he said: \"It's astonishing that 27 European countries can agree on things a lot more readily than, frankly, our politicians. They should actually take a lesson from the solidarity the Europeans have shown over the last couple of years.\" Mr Allan said politicians needed to put their \"prejudices behind them\", and try to find a settlement in an \"open-minded way\". \"I think it would be great to erase red lines and for people to start thinking about the national interest as opposed to party interests or, as I think some politicians have been doing, their own personal self-interests.\" The withdrawal agreement was \"non-negotiable\", he said, adding that MPs had three choices: First, a no deal, which would be \"extremely damaging to the UK economy. I can't believe any sane politicians would like to do that\"; second, a compromise that a majority of MPs can agree on; third, revoke Article 50. \"Those are the only three options and it shouldn't take our politicians too long if they tackle it positively and sincerely to get to a solution to that.\" Separately, the CBI issued an official response to the extension of Article 50 until 31 October, which was agreed in Brussels in the early hours of Thursday.

		"InputText": "By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter The rise in the year to the end of December was the first time the annual increase in prices was above 1% for the whole year. Slow price growth would be welcomed by many first-time buyers. But the building society's figures show that raising a deposit remains a significant hurdle. To raise a deposit of 20% would take up the entire pre-tax annual income of a typical earner, the Nationwide said. The building society, which draws the figures from its own mortgage data, said that house prices rose by 0.1% in December compared with the previous month. This meant the average home was valued at £215,282. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that housing market activity had been slow but relatively stable during the year. Strong employment levels and historically cheap mortgages had maintained demand despite uncertainty in the economy, owing to the global picture and the debate over Brexit. Commentators suggest the result of the general election should provide some short-term clarity over the Brexit process and some more demand for housing. \"These are early days for a bruised and fragile market, but with plenty of pent-up demand and supply, price growth may quickly accelerate past 2019's modest annual pace,\" said Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders. \"Nevertheless these first few months of 2020 will be all about establishing what the new norm really looks like in different parts of the UK.\" Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of lender Octane Capital, said: \"London may have been the weakest performing region in 2019 but that may well change this year. The capital certainly won't be returning to the obscene growth rates of yesteryear but it may drag itself off the bottom of the table. \"The property market has entered 2020 on a positive note but all eyes will be on how the economy holds up as we exit the EU.\" Saving for a deposit Potential first-time buyers will not want prices to rocket, given the difficulty already in saving for a deposit. The Nationwide suggests that anyone trying to put money aside for a 20% deposit to buy a typical first-time buyer property faces years of saving. If they set aside 15% of their take-home pay each month it would take more than five years to raise the money for a home in the North of England and Scotland. In Wales and Northern Ireland, it would take prospective buyers nearly seven years, and almost eight years for people living in the West Midlands. That increases to nearly a decade in the South of England, and around 15 years in London, the building society said. As a result of that pressure, a greater proportion of first-time buyers now rely on financial assistance from family and friends.",

It found in some areas, poorer students were up to five grades behind. The Department for Education says it provided over £530m in 2020-21 to support college students. Students from poorer families begin their A-level or vocational courses already behind more affluent students, and continue to fall further behind, according to analysis by the EPI. In the first ever study to measure the education \"disadvantage gap\" among students aged 16-19, provisional findings show that across all qualifications, poorer students are the equivalent of three A-level grades behind similar students from richer families. But there were variations across England, with poorer students the equivalent of around five A-level grades behind in areas including Knowsley on Merseyside, North Somerset and Stockton-on-Tees. In sharp contrast in many London areas, poorer students are level with or even slightly ahead of their more affluent peers. The EPI looked at students' free school meal status during their last six years of school and their attainment, based on qualifications and grades between the end of secondary school and by the age of 19. It finds the gap is bigger in A-levels than vocational qualifications. The researchers say there was no progress in closing the gap between 2017 to 2019, and suggest it is likely to get worse due the impact of the pandemic which has effected poorer communities more severely. Sam Tuckett, senior researcher at the EPI, said: \"For the very first time, this exploratory research gives us a clear understanding of how disadvantaged sixth form and college students are progressing with their learning compared to their peers. \"Our findings demonstrate very plainly that deep-seated inequalities follow poorer teenagers from school through to sixth form and college, and continue to widen further compared to otherwise similar students, as they work towards their qualifications.\" The big gaps in grades is largely explained by poorer students already having lower grades at the end of their GCSEs, the researchers say. Disadvantaged students are also more likely to take fewer and lower-level qualifications which adds to the gap in results. 'Learning losses' There is a \"strong case\" for extra funding for 16-19 education to stop poor pupils falling further behind, the report suggests. And targeted support is urgently needed to address learning losses caused by the pandemic, which is likely to impact the poorest students the most. David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, called for the pupil premium which gives extra money to schools to help poorer pupils, to be extended beyond the age of 16. \"Young people in England's school sixth forms and colleges have lower hours of teaching, less support and less enrichment than their peers in other countries, and less than those in private schools. That needs to change. Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said the report provides a welcome perspective on the \"chronic underfunding\" of sixth form education. \"There is now a broad consensus that young people need additional support to recover from the disruption to their education caused by Covid, but as this report illustrates, sixth forms and colleges have been helping students to recover from a range of disadvantages for many years.\" A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"We are determined to ensure disadvantaged students are properly supported while studying at college or sixth form so they can gain the skills they need to progress. \"This includes providing extra funding for disadvantaged 16 to 19-year-old students, specifically those with low prior attainment or who live in the most disadvantaged areas.\"",

Lord Hall will say the arts are at risk of becoming marginalised for future generations unless more is done to get children and young people engaged. As part of the plans, acclaimed 1960s arts show Civilisation is to return. The landmark 13-part series series telling the history of western art was fronted by art historian Kenneth Clark when it was screened by BBC Two in 1969. The BBC is now looking for a new authoritative presenter to follow in Clark's footsteps for the new series, which will use modern digital technology to provide a fresh overview of the history of art. The BBC said: \"Civilisation was a landmark programme. Producing something of equal scale will be a huge challenge, but we believe it is time to once again create something with the same impact for a new generation. \"The arts have been central to the BBC's past and are central to its future. As all arts organisations face the challenge of delivering more in a tight economic climate, it is vital that we work together in new ways to create a bigger and better offer to the public.\" As well as including arts content in The One Show, the idea will be spread to other popular programmes such as BBC Radio 2's Simon Mayo show. Lord Hall announced last October that funding for the BBC's arts coverage would increase by 20%. The director general, who was Royal Opera House chief executive for 12 years before his appointment to the BBC, said he wanted to return the arts to the corporation's \"heart\".

		"InputText": "By Mark SavageMusic reporter In 2013, the Italian composer was reported as saying he wouldn't work with Tarantino because he \"places music in his films without coherence\". But the 87-year-old told the BBC he had no issues with how the director incorporated his older works into films like Kill Bill and Django Unchained. \"On the contrary, I was very, very flattered,\" he said. \"The fact that my music, which had been written for other films, could be adapted to the poetry of Quentin Tarantino's film-making was a great gift for me. \"The only thing I criticised of Quentin Tarantino was a single scene in a single movie which, for me, was too violent and too ghastly. I couldn't watch it.\" Speaking through an interpreter, the maestro said his original comments had been mis-reported, adding: \"People should pay a lot of attention when they write something down.\" The pair have now collaborated for the first time, with the Italian maestro penning the soundtrack for Tarantino's upcoming film The Hateful Eight. It marks the first time the composer has scored a Western since his career-defining work with Sergio Leone on films such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; and Once Upon a Time in the West. It is also a first for Tarantino - who has never commissioned a full orchestral score for one of his films before, preferring to rely on old soundtracks and classic pop records. Morricone says it was Tarantino's dense script that persuaded him to work on the project. \"It was this thick,\" he says, indicating a document several times thicker than War and Peace. \"He actually came to Rome just to convince me, to my house. \"It was very easy for me to say yes because the script was very, very relevant and interesting and full of detail.\" The Hateful Eight, which is released in January, reunites Tarantino with several of his regular players - Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern - as well as newcomers Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bichir and Channing Tatum. Set roughly a decade after the US Civil War, it finds an eclectic group of law-keepers, outlaws, mercenaries, bounty hunters and fugitives trapped in a stagecoach waypoint by a massive snowstorm. As the plot unfurls, they begin to wonder whether they'll make it out alive. The score's key movement is a seven-minute suite called L'Ultima Diligenza per Red Rock - a piece of which Morricone is particularly proud. \"The main instruments introducing this piece are the bassoon, the contra-bassoon and the tuba,\" he says. \"And this is very strange because I have never done that in the past. \"The sound these instruments produce can express the drama, the rage, the despair and the irony that are the main themes of Tarantino's story. They are a healthy, bodily sound. They also express a criticism towards the leading characters of the film.\" A sinister, brooding passage of music, it will form the centrepiece of the composer's world tour next year, celebrating his 60 years in the film industry. Despite his age - and the lingering pain from a back injury he sustained last year - Morricone says he is \"looking forward\" to the concerts, and finds playing themes from films such as The Mission, Cinema Paradiso and A Fistful of Dollars an \"incredibly gratifying experience\". The composer has scored more than 500 films, sold more than 70 million albums, scored a top 10 single in the UK (with Chi Mai in 1982) and received an honorary Oscar - but he has no intention of resting on his laurels. \"I've been working for many years and the sum of all these experiences led me always to improve, to do better,\" he says. \"Every piece of work I do adds something to my experience and my style, and brings something new.\" And had he been able to stomach the violence in Tarantino's latest movie? \"The fact I don't like those sequences is not a problem. It's a question of my personal sensitivity,\" he says. \"I would go to the extent to say that maybe he can afford to include those violent sequences because it's part of his poetry. \"The world can be a very cruel place and he has a wonderful way of describing this cruelty.\" The Hateful Eight is out in the UK on 8 January.

Woman's Hour said it hoped publishing the power list would lead to better representation. \"It's a celebration of 40 incredible women but hopefully it doesn't stop there,\" said broadcaster Tina Daheley, who led the panel of judges. \"A lot of the people on the list are coming on to the programme, and I think that's where the conversation will start.\" Woman's Hour Power List 2018 - The Top 10 Daheley said the top 40 was whittled down from a longlist of 100 names, with judges looking for women \"who've had an impact over the last 12 months\". Beyoncé \"absolutely deserves to be number one\", she added. \"She's one of those people who's absolutely in charge of her own destiny and she's using that platform in a way that makes a difference: empowering black people in America, addressing injustice head-on and championing women. \"It's not just the lyrics and activism in her music which, you could cynically say, sells music,\" she continues. \"She puts her money where her mouth is and she's contributed to Black Lives Matter and the people affected by Hurricane Katrina.\" Taylor Swift was praised by the panel for standing up to streaming companies like Apple and Spotify over royalties, and for successfully winning a sexual assault case against a US ex-radio DJ, over an incident in 2013. \"When I see young girls and how she empowers them to be strong women, I see how much she's influenced them and her impact on these girls who will be the activists of the future,\" said judge Jasmine Dotiwala, a music TV producer and columnist. Daheley was also keen to highlight figures like Fiona Stewart who, at the age of 18, was a single mum living in homeless shelters - but now runs the Green Man Festival. \"Her story's incredible - but it's also her attitude to music festivals. She refuses corporate sponsorship and she won't have a VIP area. She's very impressive. She's lower down the list, but still being celebrated.\" The list also includes Sarah Stennett, the CEO of First Access Entertainment, which manages Rita Ora, Ray BLK and Bebe Rexha \"I never thought consciously of my gender as something that limited me in any way until this year,\" Stennett told BBC News. \"I was just too busy trying to push forward and survive in the cut-throat environment of the male-dominated entertainment business. \"It took an essay my daughter wrote on the effects women face from subconscious patriarchal oppression for me to finally stop and realise that it was that oppression itself which was part of my relentless drive not to fail and which has, in fact, helped me achieve a level of success that has enabled me to be part of this list. \"I hope that any success achieved will help other women close the gap on the gender imbalance in business.\" Woman's Hour publishes its Power List annually, focusing on a different theme each time. As well as Daheley and Dotiwala, this year's panel included novelist Jessica Duchen, record producer Catherine Marks and musician Kate Nash.

She earned $15.5m (£12.6m) more than she did in 2018, thanks largely to the success of Avengers: Endgame. Modern family actor Sofia Vergara is the only other woman to break into the overall top 10. Earlier this week, Dwayne Johnson was announced as the highest-paid actor of the last 12 months, making $89.4m (£73.6m) according to the latest annual rankings from the financial experts. Notably all of the top 10 actresses earned above $20m (£16.3) this year, compared with last year when only the top two - Johansson and Angelina Jolie made that amount. Johansson is set to reprise her title role in the Avengers spin-off Black Widow next year. Meanwhile, Jolie - who earned $28m (£22.8) in 2018 - drops out of this year's top 10 due to increased earnings for several of the highest earners in the top 10. She is currently acting in and producing two forthcoming films - Maleficent: Mistress of Evil and The One and Only Ivan. Other names to drop out of the top 10 this year include Mila Kunis, Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett, Melissa McCarthy and Gal Gadot. Unlike the male actors list, there's a notable lack of diversity among this year's highest earning women. Vergara is Colombian-American, but there are no black actresses in the top 10. Forbes list of the world's best-paid female actors 2019 The list of top earning male actors was released on Wednesday. Dwayne Johnson - aka The Rock - climbed from his number two placing last year - despite his earnings actually being less than the $119m (£98.1m) he made in 2018. Last year's number one actor George Clooney has dropped out of the top 10. That's because his high earnings on 2018's list were down to the sale of his tequila company, in a deal worth $1bn (£753m). The lists include celebrities' overall earnings, including brand endorsements and don't solely consist of payments for acting. Johnson's endorsements include sportswear firm Under Armour. In the last year, he has starred in the Fast & Furious spin-off Hobbs & Shaw, Skyscraper and has produced films like Fighting with My Family and Shazam!. Later this year, he will star in Jumanji: The Next Level alongside Kevin Hart and Jack Black. Elsewhere in this year's top 10, Chris Hemsworth has climbed to second place with earnings of $76.4m (£62.9m) Bradley Cooper has re-entered the top 10 for the first time since 2015 thanks in large part to directing, co-writing, co-producing and starring in the Oscar-winning A Star Is Born. He is the sixth highest earner at $57m (£46.9m) Having only appeared in one major film in the last year (Aladdin), Will Smith is down slightly this year, with his earnings of $35m (£28.8m) placing him 10th.

He quit 1Xtra in August when a reporter repeated racist language allegedly used in a hit-and-run attack in Bristol. The report prompted 18,600 complaints. The BBC initially defended the decision to use the N-word, saying it had been made following careful consideration and with the approval of the victim and their family. Sideman, whose real name is David Whitely, announced he was stepping down from his radio show over the incident on 8 August. In a statement, he said the \"action and the defence of the action feels like a slap in the face of our community\". A day later, the BBC's then-director general Tony Hall overruled the BBC's defence of the report, and apologised for the use of the slur. \"Every organisation should be able to acknowledge when it has made a mistake,\" he said in an email to staff. \"We made one here. It is important for us to listen - and also to learn. And that is what we will continue to do.\" The corporation has subsequently strengthened its guidance on the use of racist language. The new rules \"now carry a presumption that such language will not normally be used\" unless a judgement at divisional director level had ruled otherwise. 'Embarrassing' When asked what BBC bosses should do to avoid similar controversies in the future, Sideman told the PA news agency the corporation should show \"understanding of the times that we are in\". He added: \"Things are changing and black people's issues are not an issue you can push under the rug any more. \"It is something that you have to address, it's something that you have to have an action plan for or these things will happen again and it will be embarrassing for you.\" The DJ said that, while there is institutional racism in the BBC, the same is true of \"almost every organisation in this country\" and he did not intend \"slander or malign\" the broadcaster. Social media impact He added that he had been surprised by the response to his resignation - which was originally announced in a video posted to social media. \"I look back on what I did and think wow, people really amplified my voice and made it louder and made it have more impact,\" he said. \"If social media didn't make the big stink of it that they did, then it wouldn't have been as monumental a thing as it was with the BBC apologising just over 24 hours later.\" Sideman wasn't the only BBC staff member to criticise the report. Larry Madowo, a US-based correspondent for BBC World, said in a tweet that the BBC's rules on racially-sensitive language were being applied inconsistently. Causing 'a stink' \"The BBC didn't allow me, an actual black man, to use the N-word in an article when quoting an African American who used it,\" he said. \"But a white person was allowed to say it on TV because it was 'editorially justified'.\" Sideman expressed regret that it had taken actions like these to prompt the BBC to change its mind. \"18,000 people complained the right way, the boring way,\" he told PA. \"They went on a website and typed in a long, boring email. What I did was a video on Instagram. \"That to me says something about our society, that what I did caused more of a stink.\" In response to his comments, the BBC said; \"We are committed to building inclusive, welcoming, modern and diverse organisation, which is why we have taken steps to change the editorial policy on offensive language, increased training for all staff, and introduced policies to improve representation on and off air. \"We have made progress in recent years, but we recognise there is more to do\" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

The latest study, published in the Journal of Medical Screening, said at least seven lives were saved for every 1,000 women screened. Health charities say the findings will provide further clarity for women. Mammograms spot dangerous tumours, increasing the chances of survival, but also detect lumps that are essentially harmless, exposing some women to undue anxiety and surgery. Tens of thousands of women die from breast cancer across Europe each year. The effectiveness of screening programmes across the continent was evaluated in a series of studies. It concluded that for every 1,000 women screened, between seven and nine lives were saved and four cases were over-diagnosed. One of the lead researchers Prof Stephen Duffy, from Queen Mary, University of London, said the study \"confirms that the screening services are delivering the benefits expected from the research studies conducted years ago\". \"In particular, it is good news that lives saved by screening outweigh over-diagnosed cases by a factor of two to one,\" he said. \"Screening doesn't just save lives today or tomorrow, it saves lives 10-20 years down the line.\" In England, the Department of Health is reviewing the evidence around breast cancer screening, which started in 1988. The findings will be published later this year. The charities Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Breast Cancer Campaign said in a joint statement: \"This hugely detailed, impressive piece of work supports the widely held view that breast screening saves lives by helping to detect breast cancer early. \"As charities, we will be working closely with the screening programme to ensure women receive the best possible information on both the potential benefits and risks of breast screening. \"In the meantime, if women have any questions we advise them to discuss these with their doctor.\" Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK's senior science information manager, said: \"This study adds to the information which is currently being independently reviewed on the harms and benefits of breast screening. The independent panel is taking account of all relevant views, studies and evidence. We look forward to the conclusions, which will be available later this year.\"",

		"InputText": "By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News Experiments on mice suggested low levels of a protein in the brain may be responsible for memory loss. It is hoped the discovery could lead to treatments to reverse forgetfulness, but it is a big leap from the mouse to a human brain. The study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, said age-related memory loss was a separate condition to Alzheimer's disease. The team at Columbia University Medical Centre started by analysing the brains of eight dead people, aged between 22 and 88, who had donated their organ for medical research. They found 17 genes whose activity level differed with age. One contained instructions for making a protein called RbAp48, which became less active with time. Memory boost Young mice genetically engineered to have low RbAp48 levels performed as poorly as much older mice in memory tests. Using a virus to boost RbAp48 in older mice appeared to reverse the decline and boosted their memory. One of the researchers, Prof Eric Kandel, said: \"The fact that we were able to reverse age-related memory loss in mice is very encouraging. \"At the very least, it shows that this protein is a major factor, and it speaks to the fact that age-related memory loss is due to a functional change in neurons of some sort. Unlike with Alzheimer's, there is no significant loss of neurons.\" It is still not known what impact adjusting levels of RbAp48 in the far more complex human brain will have or even if it is possible to manipulate levels safely. Dr Simon Ridley, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"While the findings may seem clear cut from these studies, in reality people reaching older age may well have a combination of changes happening in the brain - both age-related and those involved in the early stages of Alzheimer's. \"Separating early changes in Alzheimer's from age-related memory decline in the clinic still presents a challenge, but understanding more about the mechanisms of each process will drive progress in this area.\"",

It found most patients were still being seen within the target times at the 156 hospital trusts. But it said even the top sites were seeing their performance decline. The report comes on the last day of the BBC's NHS Winter project, which has been tracking the performance of local hospital trusts across the UK. During the seven days up to last Sunday performance of A&Es in England against the four-hour target rose to 92.8%. That is still below the 95% target and means from the start of the BBC's project at the beginning of November, the target has been missed every week. The rest of the UK is also missing the four-hour mark. 'Getting worse' The six targets analysed by the Nuffield Trust were the: The review said the poorest performing hospitals had been getting worse on most measures for a while. But it said more recently performance had also started to decline in the top 10% of hospitals, particularly in terms of A&E, hospital operations and, to a lesser extent, hospital appointments. It said this suggested the problems were \"systematic\" rather than caused by local or managerial failings. NHS performance in numbers The report acknowledged demand for services had increased significantly - the number of hospital diagnostic tests and urgent cancer referrals have both risen by more than 10% . But it said this did not necessarily seem to be directly linked to similar drops in performance. For example, the number of hospital operations being done has actually dropped slightly - but the waiting-time target is among those where performance has declined most steeply. Warning lights Report co-author Holly Dorning said: \"We've known that hospitals have been struggling to meet the four-hour A&E target for a while. \"But the fact that we are starting to see problems in other areas, like access to planned treatment, is a real concern. \"As this study makes clear, warning lights are now starting to flash across the wider hospital system.\" A spokesman for the Department of Health said: \"The NHS is busier than ever, as innovative treatments and medicines mean people are living longer with complex conditions like heart disease or diabetes. \"We've increased the NHS budget this Parliament, but ultimately we want to reduce pressure on services through our plans to increase access to primary care and look after people better in the community.\" Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: \"The NHS has been thrown off course by [Prime Minister] David Cameron's reorganisation, and it is now failing to deliver - leaving thousands of people without the standards of care they deserve.\"",

		"InputText": "In 1887, Rudyard Kipling met one of the new breed of typewriting girls while visiting San Francisco. They aroused in him a mixture of fear and fascination, insisting that their work was enjoyable and their \"natural fate\" - that was until Kipling questioned further. \"Well, and after?\" said I. \"What happens?\" \"We work for our bread.\" \"Till you die?\" \"Ye-es, unless,\" said the partner in the firm audaciously, \"sometimes we marry our employers - at least that's what the newspapers say.\" The hand banged on half a dozen of the keys of the machine at once. \"Yes, I don't care. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!\" In offices today almost all the most boring tasks are done by women. At the photocopier, at the filing cabinet (or its digital equivalent) and on the reception desk - it's females only. So much so that when a few years ago I came across my first male PA I was almost as shocked as Kipling. This feminisation of office work happened incredibly fast. Until the late 19th Century there were no women in offices at all. In 1870, there were barely a thousand of them. By 1911 there were 125,000 and by 1961 there were 1.8 million, in 2001 there were 2.5 million female clerks. But how did it all begin? A photograph taken in 1899 shows a young woman sitting on a desk, legs crossed with one foot on her chair. She's wearing a nice pair of shoes and there's a bike leaning against her desk. On the desk a half-eaten apple, a glass, a desk calendar, some files and... a Remington Standard 2 typewriter. It's a pretty racy picture for the time - you might even be able to see a hint of her upper shin, never mind ankle. But what it does show is a new type of working woman with the twin instruments of emancipation - the bicycle and, more importantly, the typewriter. As the American Journal noted in 1898: \"No expert can manage either the typewriter or the bicycle while she is held in a close-fitting cage of whalebone and steel.\" The typewriter girl, like the typewriter itself, was an American export. The first machines with the Qwerty keyboard were triumphantly brought on to the market by the US gun-maker E Remington and Sons, in 1873. But far from being popular they were a total flop and probably would have stayed that way, had not some bright spark in the marketing department had the great idea of flogging them to women - to the daughters of middle-class businessmen. \"The typewriter is especially adapted to feminine fingers. They seem to be made for typewriting. The typewriting involves no hard labour and no more skill than playing the piano,\" wrote John Harrison, in his 1888 Manual of the Typewriter. In the stores at the Museum of London are some early typewriters, including a very early Hammond model, which looks like a mahogany toilet seat. \"The major brand was the Remington,\" says Alex Werner, head of collections at the museum. \"They produced beautiful adverts with attractive women typing away.\" The keys were made for dainty figures. My fingers, clad in plastic gloves, are too clumsy. The typical typist was a liberated woman. Novelists and playwrights - George Gissing and JM Barrie - were fascinated by her, creating heroines who wore no-nonsense clothes, rode a bicycle, took up smoking and hung out with anarchists in the English countryside. A real life version of these pioneers was Janet Hogarth, who became the Bank of England's first ever female clerk in 1893. She was a high flier in her day. She had achieved first class honours in philosophy from Oxford and was a skilled linguist. But her job was a boring one. \"It was monotonous, essentially dealing with cancelling bank notes, sorting them and crossing them off in the ledgers,\" says John Keyworth, curator of the Bank of England's museum. Women were cheaper than men, and took over the jobs that were previously filled by young boys, who would have been supervised by an older man because it was so mind-bendingly boring. \"They gave her six months to learn the job,\" adds Keyworth. \"She mastered it in a very short time.\" Hogarth writes of it in her autobiography. \"It was almost unbelievably soothing to sit in the quiet upper room with nothing to do but lay out banknotes in patterns like patience cards,\" she wrote. \"Learning all about the little marks on them, crossing them up in piles like card houses, sorting them in sixties and finally entering their numbers in beautiful ledgers made of the very best paper, as if intended to last out all ages.\" In the late 19th Century it was inconceivable to have men working alongside typewriter girls, for fear of damage to their morals. Precisely how the damage was meant to occur, no-one was quite clear, but it was thought best to keep the sexes entirely separate. So men and women had different entrances, different working hours, different dining rooms and often worked behind screens or in attics so that no man could see them. An autobiography by a male employee at the Bank of England recalls how ridiculous it all was. \"The streets it was held were safe enough, but once she the woman clerk entered this forbidding fortress every imaginable horror was predicted,\" wrote the author. But that wasn't all. So as to avoid the danger of typewriter girls on the loose, many employers refused to let them out during their lunch break. Women at the Post Office were not allowed a midday breath of fresh air until 1911 - and that was only after a kicking up a huge row and making personal appeals to the postmaster general. So how did men feel about their new female colleagues? The answer - predictably - was that they weren't happy at all. Part of the hostility was fair enough. The women were an endless source cheap competition. A particularly patronising piece was published in the Liverpool Echo in 1911: \"These intrepid typewriter pounders, instead of being allowed to gloat over love novels or do fancy crocheting during the time they are not 'pounding', should fill in their spare time washing out the offices and dusting same, which you will no doubt agree is more suited to their sex and maybe would give them a little practice and insight into the work they will be called up to do should they so far demean themselves as to marry one of the poor male clerks whose living they are doing their utmost to take out of his hands at the present time.\" But actually the arrival of women in the office wasn't altogether bad for men. If they had working daughters - as many did - their households were better off. And as women were given the most tedious things to do, men's chances of promotion were higher. And then, of course, the women were easy on the eye and possible candidates for future wives and mistresses. Meanwhile, at the Bank of England, the chief accountant, a Mr Stuchbury, was hard at work with his stopwatch calculating whether employing women was such a good idea after all. He studied a question that has always interested me - are women more conscientious than men. His answer was much as I'd figured out for myself - yes. He found that 37 women had counted as many notes as 47 men, and with fewer mistakes. But he also noted that women were off sick more often than boys (which is still pretty much the case). Stuchbury thought this was a clincher, but the secretary managed to head him off, pointing out that long term, women worked out a lot cheaper. There was, he argued, \"a considerable future saving of expense… when it is borne in mind that women clerks would not attain higher pay than £85 against £300 earned by all other clerks.\" In other words, the great thing about women was that you didn't have to promote them. The glass ceiling was in evidence (only then it was set at roughly ankle height) from the very start. There was another good thing. Thanks to the marriage bar (which, extraordinarily, stayed in place until the 1960s), the supply of women was constantly replenished - as they married and left, new girls took their place. But what of the women who didn't get married? Well they got promoted - but only a little. It was their job to look after the younger typists. This was the plight of Hogarth. She wrote with some bitterness: \"The girls show a zeal and zest which no boy thinks of emulating. But the trouble comes when they grow to be middle-aged women and are still kept at work only fit for beginners. They have become mere machines.\" Hogarth left the bank in 1905 for a job as principal of Cheltenham College - possibly more fitting to a woman of her intelligence. It would be a while before a woman had a crack at the interesting stuff at the Bank of England. More than 100 years later, we've had four women on the monetary policy committee, though still no female governor.

		"gpt-3.5-turbo": "In the late 19th century, women began to occupy clerical jobs in offices, with typewriter girls being one of the earliest roles. American gun-maker Remington and Sons brought the qwerty keyboard typewriter to market in 1873, but sales were poor until marketing executives targeted young women. By 1911 there were 125,000 female clerks in the UK and by 1961 there were 1.8 million; that number had risen to 2.5 million by 2001. At first, men and women in offices worked separately, and women were only allowed out on lunch breaks after 1911. Men were mostly unhappy about women taking their jobs, but appreciated that they were cheaper than male staff. Women got few opportunities for promotion and often ended up stuck in the same jobs."

		"InputText": "And for some surrogate mums, the experience of carrying another family's baby is just as joyful. Chloe is 28, a mum of three, and she gave birth to her first surrogate child in August 2017. She's been talking to Newsbeat about why she decided to become a surrogate after having her three children. \"When my daughter was born, it was the most amazing experience,\" she said. \"I instantly fell in love with this little baby and it broke my heart to think there are parents out there who will never have this.\" Chloe has a five-year-old and three-year-old twins. After the birth of their twins, she and her husband decided together that they wanted to help other families. Chloe joined Surrogacy UK, an organisation which supports surrogates and couples who are unable to have children, who they refer to as \"intended parents\". She was introduced to a couple and describes getting to know them as \"almost like dating.\" \"You offer to exclusively get to know them,\" she says. \"We then spent just over four months getting to know each other. We did days out, takeaways in. Normal things you do with friends. \"We built up a relationship and we had faith and trust in each other so we started the IVF process. \"They used the biological mum's egg, the biological father's sperm - I was just the oven at the end. I did the cooking.\" Chloe says her experience of surrogate pregnancy was very different to when she was expecting her own children. \"I was excited to be a mum and to welcome my babies into the world,\" she says. \"This time, I'd liken it to looking after someone else's child. \"I very much view it as a baby to give back, I don't view it as mine to give up.\" And Chloe found it easier to explain the situation to her children than she did some adults. \"I said to my children the intended mother's tummy is broken and doesn't work properly so she can't have her babies so mummy is going to grow their baby and when it's all grown and born, we're going to give it back,\" she said. \"Adults on the whole tend to be a bit nosier, know biology a little bit better so they tend to ask a few more questions.\" In the UK, it is illegal for surrogates to get paid for a baby, but during the pregnancy the intended parents will pay for the mum's essentials. And this comes in handy when pregnancy cravings strike. \"My expenses are covered, so things like fuel, clothing and all the extras that come with pregnancy, all the strange food cravings, all the late night trips to McDonalds for instance,\" says Chloe. \"I had a real hankering for those milkshakes.\" When Chloe gave birth, the intended parents had a room in the same hospital so the child could be a part of their family immediately. She says many adults struggle to understand why she would be a surrogate, but less than six months after giving birth, Chloe is ready to do it all over again. \"I am in that 'get to know' period with another couple,\" she says. \"I do feel like I've been pregnant forever but to be honest I adore pregnancy. I love being pregnant and I don't suffer like some people do. \"I honestly feel like I breeze it and my husband is willing to put up with me hormonal again.\" \"It seems like a good time to do it again while I'm young and then I can say I've done my piece.\" Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here",

		"InputText": "By Mark KinverEnvironment reporter, BBC News The European Environment Agency (EEA) listed tiny airborne particles and ozone as posing a \"significant threat\". However, the authors said nations had significantly cut emissions of a number of pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, lead and carbon monoxide. In a separate study, research identified a link between low birth-weight and exposure to air pollution. EEA executive director Hans Bruyninckx said that EU nations had made considerable progress over recent decades to reduce the visible signs of air pollution, with cities now no longer shrouded in blankets of smog. However, he added: \"Air pollution is causing damage to human health and ecosystems. Large parts of the population do not live in a healthy environment, according to current standards. \"To get on to a sustainable path, Europe will have to be ambitious and go beyond current legislation.\" The EEA report showed that data suggested that up to 96% of the EU's urban population was exposed to fine particulate matter concentrations above UN World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Even more, 98%, were subject to ground-level ozone concentrations above WHO recommended levels. As well has urban outdoor air quality, the report also highlighted that the natural environment was also continuing to suffer. It said ecosystem were subject to the pressure of air pollution impairing vegetation growth and harming biodiversity.\" The EEA also produced country-by-country breakdown of air quality data. Responding to the report's findings, Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik said: \"Air quality is a central concern for many people. \"Surveys show that a large majority of citizens understand well the impact of air quality on health and are asking public authorities to take action at EU, national and local levels.\" He added that he was willing to address those concerns in the Commission's Air Policy Review. Infant concerns A separate study, also published on Tuesday, concluded that a substantial proportion of the cases of low birth-weight (less than 2.5kg at 37 weeks of gestation) \"could be prevented in Europe if urban air pollution was reduced\". The findings, published in the The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal, said: \"The population attributable risk estimated for a reduction in [particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less] concentration to 10 micrograms per cubic metre during pregnancy corresponded to a decrease of 22% in cases of low birth-weight at term.\" A team of European researchers carried out what they describe as one of the largest studies of its kind, collating data from more than 74,000 births between 1994 and 2011 across 12 European nations. They explained that babies with low birth-weights were at greater risk of mortality and health problems than infants with higher birth-weights. \"Low birth-weight has been associated with wheezing and asthma in childhood, and with decreased lung function in adults,\" they observed but added that there was inconsistency in the findings. \"In addition to active and passive smoking, atmospheric pollution exposure is a highly prevalent and controllable risk factor for low birth-weight.\" Lead author Dr Marie Pedersen from the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain, observed: \"The widespread exposure of pregnant women worldwide to urban ambient air pollution at similar or even higher concentrations than those assessed in our study provides a clear message to policymakers to improve the quality of the air we all share.\" Current EU legislation has sent the annual mean limit on fine particulate matter at 20 micrograms per cubic metre for particles measuring 2.5 microns (PM2.5) or less. This is twice the concentration outlined in World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which recommends an annual mean limit for PM2.5 exposure to 10 micrograms per cubic metre. These microscopic particles (the diameter of a human hair ranges between 15 and 180 microns) end up in the atmosphere from a range of sources, including road transport emissions, and have been linked to heart and lung disease, cancer and premature death. Prof Bruyninckx described the Lancet paper's findings as \"very concerning\", adding that despite progress being made in some areas, more action was needed to tackle air pollution. \"It is the explicit goal of the European Commission to narrow that gap, and in the long run, close that gap because we are... concerned about citizens' health,\" he told BBC News. But he explained: \"Before you make binding legislation, you want to be on absolutely solid ground scientifically. \"Now, we know that [particulate matter] is having a significant impact so we need to adjust our rules and regulations accordingly.\" Commenting on the findings published in The Lancet, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists spokesman Dr Patrick O'Brien said the research was \"very helpful in providing further evidence on the potential health impacts of air pollution\". But he added: \"Exposure to some level of air pollution is unavoidable in day-to-day life and the risk still remains fairly low. \"Other factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure or excessive alcohol consumption, may contribute more to the risk of having a low birth weight baby.\"",

		"InputText": "By Helen BriggsBBC News More than 20 rice, wheat and yam plants have been listed as threatened on the latest version of the IUCN's Red list. The wild plants are being squeezed out by intensive farming, deforestation and urban sprawl, say scientists. Modern crops can be crossbred with their wild cousins to safeguard foods. ''To lose them would be a disaster,'' said Dr Nigel Maxted of the University of Birmingham, who is co-chair of the IUCN's specialist group on crop wild relatives. ''It would be much more difficult to maintain food security without them.'' Insurance policy Commercial crops have lost genetic diversity. They are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which may bring drought, diseases and new pests. Work is under way to breed new varieties of grains, cereals and vegetables by crossing them with tough, wild species that can grow in a range of habitats, such as mountains, deserts or salt marshes. These efforts rely on protecting plants related to modern food crops at the sites where they grow in the wild as well as preserving their seeds in gene banks. The first systematic assessment of wild wheat, rice and yam has led to the listing of three types of rice, two types of wheat (used to make bread) and 17 types of yam. Marie Haga is Executive Director of The Crop Trust, an international organisation that is working to safeguard crop diversity. She welcomed the inclusion of wild crops on the Red List. ''The IUCN has high legitimacy among decision makers and the general population, so it's extremely interesting that they are putting these wild relatives on their Red List,'' she told BBC News. ''I hope that will contribute to raising the awareness even further that we've got to take action, and we've got to take action now.'' Wild relatives of crops act as ''an insurance policy for the world'', she added. Most of the wild rice crops that are threatened with extinction grow in South East Asia, while a few are found in Africa. The wild wheat plants that are of concern are found mainly in the Near and Middle East, including war-torn areas that are off-limits to conservationists. Yams feed around 100 million people in Africa alone. Paul Wilkin of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said conservation work is being undertaken to make sure that wild yam plants are available to provide food and medicines worldwide, now and in the future. ''They will also be sources of key traits to breed improved, future-proof crop varieties,'' he said. ''These assessments enable the most threatened species of yams and other crop wild relatives to be prioritised effectively for conservation actions.'' The economic value of crop wild relatives is put at US$115bn per year to the global economy. Other Red List entries In addition to wild crops, the IUCN highlighted other flora and fauna that have been added to the latest update of the Red List: But there is a success story; kiwis in New Zealand are recovering thanks to conservation efforts. An effort to wipe out predators such as stoats and ferrets, as well as raising chicks in captivity to release in the wild, has boosted the number of two species of New Zealand's native bird.

But that compared with 6.5% for boys in 2016 and 44% of schools in England still send no girls at all to study the subject. The IoP said physics-based skills were essential for many future careers, from artificial intelligence to aerospace. However, the gender balance at physics A-level in England's schools has changed little in decades, with only 20% being female. \"There is no evidence to suggest any intrinsic differences in ability or interest to explain why girls and boys choose technical subjects differently,\" said IoP President, Prof Dame Julia Higgins. \"The consequences of girls' choices at school are that many rewarding and fulfilling routes are closed off to them.\" Snapshot The report, Why Not Physics? - A Snapshot of Girls' Uptake at A-level, found only 1.9% of girls chose A-level physics in 2016, compared with 6.5% of boys. In 2011, 1.6% of girls chose the subject, compared with 6.1% of boys. In contrast, 8% of girls and 12.3% of boys progressed to maths A-level. In subjects such as English and psychology, the trend is reversed, with far more girls than boys choosing the subjects. The report makes a number of recommendations: The IoP is hosting a summit on Thursday to tackle gender inequality in the classroom and to debate new ways to close the gender gap in the take-up of physics A-level. \"An ill-judged quip that girls 'can't do maths', or 'physics is too hard', can lead to girls making life-changing decisions that alter the subjects they study or the career they pursue,\" said Prof Higgins in a foreword to the report. \"Women in physics are still in the minority, and this lack of visibility preserves the myth and cements the fact that physics is simply not a subject for girls.\" Skills gap The lack of girls studying physics to a higher level also had consequences for the UK economy, the report said. Physics-based skills are required in many growth areas, from aerospace to artificial intelligence, and thousands more workers need to be trained every year to keep the UK economy competitive. A recent study found that closing the gender gap in physics would take hundreds of years, given the current rate of progress. Research analysing the names of authors listed on millions of scientific papers found physics, computer science, maths and chemistry had the fewest women, while nursing and midwifery had the most. Without further interventions, the gender gap was likely to persist for generations, said scientists from the University of Melbourne. Forecasts suggest it will take a very long time to close the gender gap in some fields, with predictions of 320 years for nursing, 280 years for computer science, 258 years for physics and 60 years for mathematics.

		"InputText": "By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent, Katowice 1. The rules are key to the game However dull it may be, the operational rules for the 2015 Paris climate agreement will govern the way the world tackles climate change for decades to come. The key thing was not to unravel the carefully negotiated Paris agreement by having one set of rules for the rich countries and another one for the poor. By that measure the conference was a success with China showing leadership by not pushing for a return to the old ways of countries who did, and countries who didn't. Also helping that effort was the US. Ensuring that the China and the US face similar regulations has long been a key of American policy. Keeping everyone on the same page also delighted the EU. Climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete explained how the new rules would work. \"We have a system of transparency, we have a system of reporting, we have rules to measure our emissions, we have a system to measure the impacts of our policies compared to what science recommends.\" To keep everyone in check, the rules will also contain a compliance mechanism, which means that countries that don't submit their reports on time will face an inquiry. The new regulations are \"flexible\" for developing countries, meaning they can sign up to the rules at a later date. 2. Science is worth fighting for One of the biggest rows at this meeting was over a key scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). A group of countries including Saudi Arabia, US, Kuwait and Russia refused to \"welcome\" the IPCC study. They merely wanted to \"note\" the contents. Efforts to find a compromise ended in failure. However that was not the end of the matter. The vast majority of countries felt that acknowledging the science was critical at this conference. Their efforts did finally ensure that the IPCC was recognised - but many felt it was a token effort. \"That science is unsettling and it doesn't connect it to the need to do more,\" said Camilla Born from the environmental think tank E3G. \"The deal looks at it in isolation, it's an elegant compromise but it's not really enough.\" 3. International spirit is still alive Many countries had worried that with the rise of nationalism in many countries and the recent election of Jair Bolsonaro as Brazil's president, the international co-operation needed to tackle climate change might be in danger. For many getting agreement here in Katowice was less about technical rules and more about showing that the international spirit is still alive and has teeth. \"I think the beauty of multilateralism is that it is the effort of everybody,\" said Spanish Ecology Minister Teresa Ribera. \"And what we have seen is that everybody has supported the package, no single country has decided to step down. \"It is very difficult. It is like organising a party for 200 friends, and there's a single menu that everybody has to eat. It is not so easy but we have got it. That's fantastic!\" 4. A win for the process but not for the planet? While negotiators have been congratulating themselves on a job well done in landing the rulebook, there are many voices here who feel that the agreement does not go far enough. They point to the strength of the science, and the public recognition of the impacts of climate change seen this year in heatwaves and wildfires. How years compare with the 20th Century average 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Months Source: NOAA Many environmental campaigners believe that Katowice was a missed opportunity for radical action. \"We have ended up here with more of a coal trade fair than a climate convention,\" said Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid, referring to the efforts to promote coal by Poland and the US at this conference. \"We haven't acted in good faith, particularly for the young, that we takes seriously what science is telling us and we are responding to it. That message didn't come through. \"If people think the rulebook is the way to get the world on that path, it is not robust or ambitious enough.\" 5. New voices are emerging One of the most striking things about this conference of the parties was the presence of energised young people in far greater numbers than I have ever seen them at a COP before. Climate change chimes with young people in a way that is sometimes missing with older people, who make up the bulk of negotiators here. The sense that perhaps this UN process doesn't quite connect with the modern world was summed up best by Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives and now their lead climate negotiator. \"Almost 10 years since I was last at these climate negotiations, I must say, nothing much seems to have changed. \"We are still using the same old, dinosaur language. Still saying the same old words. \"Still making the same tedious points.\" It would be hard to argue with this view given the shenanigans that played out at the end, when one country, Brazil, held up progress at the talks on one issue for a couple of days. Perhaps the most memorable image of this meeting was that of 15-year-old Swedish student Greta Thunberg. This teenager who has organised school strikes in Sweden held daily press conferences here to drive home her message that platitudes and warm words just aren't enough anymore. Her message was sharp and succinct. \"We cannot solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis.\"",

Small island states believe keeping temperatures below 1.5C this century is critical to their survival. A key report in October said this was possible. But huge emissions cuts would be needed in the short term. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on 1.5C was commissioned by the UN back in 2015. But when it was presented to climate negotiators in December in Poland, four countries including the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait refused to \"welcome\" it. The simmering battle over the report has re-emerged here at this meeting in Bonn. There has been a serious battle over a text that would include reference to the scientists' conclusion that carbon emissions would have to be reduced by 45% by 2030. Saudi Arabia has been at the fore in wanting to include text that underlined the uncertainties in the report. For the group of around 40 small island states, this has proved inflammatory. \"The report came out in in October of 2018 and now we see this move at the negotiations to try and have it almost erased from existence, which is impossible to do,\" Lois Young, the ambassador from Belize, who is chairing the group, told the BBC. \"There's this move to pretend as though it's not there, to not to refer to it in documents. And it's been ongoing since we got here.\" The Saudis have gained some support in their arguments from an unlikely alliance of countries, including the US, Australia and Iran. \"The countries that are trying to downplay the importance of the document, erase it from the records, not all of them are showing their faces,\" said Ambassador Young. \"It's unreal, it's as though they're resigning our Aosis states to collateral damage, I mean, it's like we have no importance doesn't matter.\" Other observers here believe that the IPCC report has been a critical document in helping raise public awareness of the threat posed by climate change. \"The report has had a transformational effect, not just with the UK now passing a net zero law, but with public opinion around the world,\" said Alden Meyer, from the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"But there is a fault line between a handful of countries, most of them major oil producers on the significance and status of the report. But they can't put the stopper back in the bottle and pretend the report doesn't exist.\" Efforts at finding a compromise are ongoing here in Bonn, with some delegates believing that both the goals for 2030 and the Saudi questions about uncertainty can be accommodated. These talks are due to finish later today but if an agreed text can't be found, the increasingly rancorous debate may spill into the open at the final meeting this afternoon.

		"InputText": "By Helen BriggsBBC Science correspondent The famous naturalist was haunted by the question of how the first flowering plants evolved. Darwin feared this inexplicable puzzle would undermine his theories of evolution, says Prof Richard Buggs. Forgotten historical documents show a rival scientist was arguing for divine intervention in the rise of the flowering plants. This greatly vexed Darwin in his final months, says the evolutionary biologist at Queen Mary, University of London. \"The mystery seems to have been made particularly abominable to him by its highly publicised use by the keeper of botany at the British Museum to argue for divine intervention in the history of life,\" he says. What is the abominable mystery? Darwin coined the phrase, abominable mystery, in 1879. In a letter to his closest friend, botanist and explorer Dr Joseph Hooker, he wrote: \"The rapid development as far as we can judge of all the higher plants within recent geological times is an abominable mystery.\" The mystery centres on the rise of the flowering plants, or angiosperms, the family of plants that produce flowers and bear their seeds in fruits. They make up the vast majority of all known living plants, from oaks to wildflowers and water lilies. Flowering plants appeared on Earth relatively recently on a geological timescale, then swiftly diversified in an explosion of colour, shape and form. \"In the fossil record they appear very suddenly in the Cretaceous, dated at about 100 million years ago, and there's nothing that looks like an angiosperm before them and then they suddenly appear and in considerable diversity,\" says Prof Buggs. Questions raised by the sudden appearance of flowering plants are at the heart of Darwin's abominable mystery, he explains. \"Why isn't there a gradual evolution of the angiosperms? Why can't we see intermediate forms between the gymnosperms - things like conifers - and the flowering plants? And why, when they appear, are they already so diverse?\" Why was Darwin puzzled? Darwin was deeply bothered by how flowering plants conquered the world seemingly in the blink of an eye, while other large groups, such as the mammals, evolved gradually. The advent of flowering plants suggested evolution could be both rapid and abrupt, in direct contradiction to an essential element of natural selection, natura non facit saltum - nature makes no leap. Darwin toyed with the idea that flowering plants might have evolved on an as yet undiscovered island or continent. In August 1881, only months before his death, he wrote to Hooker: \"Nothing is more extraordinary in the history of the Vegetable Kingdom, as it seems to me, than the apparently very sudden or abrupt development of the higher plants. I have sometimes speculated whether there did not exist somewhere during long ages an extremely isolated continent perhaps near the South Pole.\" What's the new thinking? In the library at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Prof Buggs came across a re-print of a lecture from 1876 by the Scottish botanist William Carruthers that gives new context to Darwin's thinking. William Carruthers rose to become keeper of botany at the British Museum, and \"a towering figure at the time in paleobotany\". In a lecture to the Geologists Association in the library of University College London, Carruthers highlighted the problems that Darwin had with the fossil record, focussing on the sudden appearance of flowering plants. His comments were reported in The Times and the scientific press, sparking a public debate. \"Carruthers was using the abominable mystery to launch an attack on evolution itself,\" says Prof Buggs. \"He thought that God had created the angiosperms in the Cretaceous; they hadn't evolved. \"To Darwin and his friends, this was anathema, basically, because [Carruthers] was trying to bring supernatural explanations into the fossil record.\" But Darwin had a problem. The points Carruthers was making about the fossil record were actually very difficult to explain in terms of evolution, says Prof Buggs. He thinks this is what prompted Darwin to coin the phrase \"an abominable mystery\" and makes his case in a scientific paper, published in the American Journal of Botany. The mystery was to Darwin what Fermat's Last Theorem was to the 17th Century mathematician Pierre de Fermat, he adds. \"It gives an insight into what was going on in Darwin's mind in the last few years of his life and it gives it an extra romance, almost, a bit like Fermat's Last Theorem - Darwin's last mystery, this problem preying on his mind in his final months.\" And is the mystery solved? In short, no. \"One hundred and forty years later, the mystery's still unsolved,\" says Prof Buggs. \"Of course, we've made lots of progress in our understanding of evolution and in our knowledge of the fossil record, but this mystery is still there.\" Follow Helen on Twitter.",

The expansion introduces the continent of Pandaria and its many inhabitants, including martially-adept pandas, to the game. The Asian-themed game is seen as an attempt to shore up WoW's dwindling subscriber base and cement its popularity in China. Competition time In early August it was revealed that the number of people playing World of Warcraft has dropped to its lowest level since 2007. In 2010, WoW claimed to have more than 12 million players but in June 2012 this had dropped to nine million. About half of these subscribers are believed to be in China. WoW creator Blizzard has tried several different strategies to keep people playing the game. It has introduced a version that is free to play in the early stages of the game. In addition, it let subscribers get a free version of its other hugely popular title Diablo 3, if they signed a 12-month contract for WoW. Part of WoW's decline has been put down to growing competition from other top tier games that have launched in recent months. Titles such as Star Wars: The Old Republic, Guild Wars 2, Diablo 3, Runescape and many other free to play games have all drawn players away from the ageing title. Mists of Pandaria is the fourth expansion for the massively multiplayer online game. Those who buy the expansion will get the chance to play as one of the Pandaren - the fighting pandas. The game also introduces a new character class to the game - the monk who uses martial arts rather than weapons to fight. As with other expansions, Blizzard is overhauling many other parts of the game at the same time as introducing Pandaria.

		"InputText": "By Leo KelionTechnology reporter The project combines an LCD flat panel screen with force sensors and a robotic arm that moves it back and forwards. By controlling how much resistance there is to a user's fingertip the firm says it can simulate the shape and weight of objects shown on screen. Microsoft says the device could have medical uses as well as for gaming. Work on the project is being carried out at the firm's Redmond campus near Seattle. Simulated shapes When a person touches the prototype it pushes back with a light force to ensure one of their fingers stays in contact with the screen. If they then press against it the robotic arm instantly pulls the screen backwards in a matching smooth movement. If they start to retract their finger, it moves it back towards them. Meanwhile a computer adjusts the size and perspective of the on-screen graphics to create a 3D effect. The trick to simulating a physical sense of touch is to adjust the amount of force-feedback resistance. So, in an application which shows graphics representing different square blocks on a wall, a \"stone\" one requires a relatively large amount of force to push it off the ledge and a \"sponge\" one less. In addition, the kit can be used to provide a sense of shape by adjusting the screen's position to match a virtual object's contours as a person drags their finger over its surface. \"As your finger pushes on the touchscreen and the senses merge with stereo vision, if we do the convergence correctly and update the visuals constantly so that they correspond to your finger's depth perception, this is enough for your brain to accept the virtual world as real,\" said senior researcher Michael Pahud. His team have used the technique to allow users to feel the shape of a virtual cup and ball, among other objects, while viewing them using special glasses to get a stereo-vision effect. Touch-and-find tumours Microsoft suggests one use for the device would be to allow doctors to explore body scans. It has created a demonstration using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of a brain to show how a medic could navigate through the different slices by pushing their finger against the display. It also allows them to draw notes and leave a \"haptic detent\" - or force-feedback marker - at certain layers to make it easier to find them again later on. In time, the researchers suggest, this could be extended to flag up potential problems. \"I could imagine receiving haptic feedback when you encountered an anomaly, such as a tumour, because we can change the response based on what you touch,\" said Mr Pahud. \"You can have different responses for when you touch soft tissue versus hard tissue, which makes for a very rich experience.\" Bumpy screens One medical tech expert said the project showed promise, but added that previous efforts to try to use touch-based feedback in robotic surgery and other health-related equipment suggested it was not yet responsive enough to be reliable. In particular, Dr Peter Weller, head of the Centre for Health Infomatics at City University, London, said he was concerned Microsoft's screen would not be able to give an accurate enough indication of textures. \"If you were moving your finger over a surface that was rough the screen would have to go up and down very quickly to be able to give you that impression,\" he told the BBC. \"The examples that they give are all very smooth - squares and cylinders and all that - but if it was going to be used in the real world it would have to respond to rapidly changing shapes.\" Others are working on different ways to provide touch-feedback. California-based Tactus, for example, has developed a screen with tiny channels of fluid which allows bumps to pop up to simulate the feel of buttons. Dr Weller suggested that if this or other such technologies could be combined with Microsoft's current research then its screen could indeed find its way into use. \"I think their example of the brain scan is a bit artificial, but where I could see it being useful would be for a doctor doing teleconsultancy work,\" he said, \"It would mean the patient could be in another country or hospital and the doctor could feel their glands or abdomen from a distance.\"",

		"InputText": "But lawyers for Ross Ulbricht, 30, said he was the \"perfect fall guy\" for the true owners of the website. He is on trial in New York, accused of making millions from the site where drugs and other illegal commodities were bought and sold. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges filed against him. And Mr Ulbricht has never admitted that he ran the site. Hidden site The charges against Mr Ulbricht include accusations of operating a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit narcotics trafficking, money laundering and computer hacking. Prosecutors claim the site generated over a million untraceable drug deals and earned Mr Ulbricht $18m (£11.9m) in bitcoin commissions under the online handle Dread Pirate Roberts. He could face life in prison if found guilty on all charges. At the scene - Nick Bryant, BBC News, New York Listening to opening arguments, it was impossible not to think of the cinematic possibilities of the Silk Road story. Take the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, in a San Francisco public library in 2013 while he was allegedly chatting online with someone he thought was a colleague but was in fact an undercover federal agent. With agents moving in fast to seize his computer, he was caught red-handed, the jury was told, with his fingers on the keyboard. Or consider the hit men he allegedly hired to kill those who posed a threat to the digital drugs empire - not that the prosecution claims anyone was actually murdered. There is the intrigue of the dark and shadowy part of the internet which Silk Road made its home. And there is the vast scale of the operation, which not only targeted a neighbourhood or city but the entire world, supposedly offering an online safe haven for drug dealers where they could conduct untraceable deals. Then there are the boasts which the 30 year old Ulbricht allegedly made: \"I am Silk Road.\" Mr Ulbricht is also accused of soliciting murders to help silence people who knew about the site and his involvement with it. There is no evidence that any of the murders were carried out. The New York trial will not deal with the murder plot charges but evidence relating to them will be presented in court. The Silk Road shut down in October 2013 following raids by the FBI and other US law enforcement agencies. The market operated from January 2011 to late 2013 during which time, the US alleges, tens of thousands of people used it to trade many different types of drugs, acquire forged documents and buy and sell hacking services. The Silk Road operated as a \"hidden service\" on the Tor dark web network allowing people to use it anonymously. Anonymity was also aided by payments for drugs and other services being carried out in bitcoins. More than 29,000 bitcoins seized during the 2013 raid were sold by US marshals in June this year for $17m (£11m). The FBI is believed to be in possession of a larger hoard of bitcoins seized from the site. Mr Ulbricht's family and friends have set up a website to help defend him saying he is innocent of all charges and had nothing to do with the Silk Road and its operation. A documentary called Deep Web has been made about the case, Mr Ulbricht's treatment and how the FBI tracked him down. It is due to be shown later this year. Supporters say the case has serious implications for online freedom because of the way it has been handled. Since the Silk Road shut down, other hidden sites have sprung up to take its place. One, called Silk Road 2.0, has been shut down due to raids by law enforcement agencies and the arrest of the man believed to be its operator.",

The work-focused social network recently announced its own plan to release a new app to help co-workers share information.

The Menlo Park, California-based firm suggested one advantage it had over rival work communication tools was that people were already familiar with the way it worked, meaning firms could save on training costs. Many companies are keen to adopt such software because of complaints that a deluge of messages has made email a poor tool to keep in touch with. \"Facebook at Work is a separate experience that gives employees the ability to connect and collaborate efficiently using Facebook tools - many that they're likely already using such as News Feed, Groups, messages and events,\" the social network said in a statement. \"The information shared among employees is only accessible to people in the company.\" A spokeswoman added: \"Internally at Facebook we've been using our product for years, and we're now looking forward to the feedback from our pilot partners to create the best possible experience.\" One industry watcher said the move was no surprise. \"If you look how popular things like Yammer have already been, that shows that there is definitely an appetite for a business skew of Facebook itself,\" said Chris Green, principal technology analyst at Davies Murphy Group Europe. \"Yammer already has a lot of the look, feel and functionality of Facebook, so it is a logical thing for Facebook to follow Yammer into the marketplace.\" Advert-free For now, the Facebook at Work app is free-to-use, but limited to an unnamed group of companies that will trial its use. At this stage the work version will not feature adverts, nor will it gather data about its users that could be sold on to third parties. \"Businesses would be concerned if it became ad-supported with information shared for context-driven marketing posts - that would be a no-no for a lot of companies on data protection grounds,\" commented Mr Green. \"Companies would probably be happier paying a subscription fee - as is the case with Yammer - and having an ad-free closed environment that they can keep total data control over.\" Facebook responded: \"It's too early discuss future plans around ads or monetisation.\"",

It follows a failed attempt to resolve the matter outside the courts. Alibaba said it was already taking action against fake goods and that it planned to fight the case. \"We continue to work in partnership with numerous brands to help them protect their intellectual property, and we have a strong track record of doing so,'' it said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, Kering Group has chosen the path of wasteful litigation instead of the path of constructive co-operation.'' But the French firm has defended its action. \"Kering and its brands dedicate a great amount of creative energy, craftsmen's know-how and monetary investments to develop products that speak to consumers and fulfil their needs,\" a spokeswoman told the BBC. \"This lawsuit is part of Kering's ongoing global effort to maintain its customers' trust in its genuine products and to continue to develop the creative works and talents in its brands.\" This is not the first time Alibaba has been criticised over illegal sales made using its platforms. Its Taobao shopping service had appeared on the US Trade Representative's list of \"notorious markets\" until 2012, at which point the US authorities recognised it was making efforts to combat the problem. However, earlier this year, one of China's own regulators accused the company of failing to give the issue \"sufficient attention\", adding that Alibaba had let the \"abscess fester until it became a danger\". The report was later pulled from China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC)'s website. Fake bags Kering originally took legal action against Alibaba last July, but dropped the case after the two sides agreed to discuss possible anti-counterfeit measures. Following the breakdown of talks, the French firm has filed a fresh, lengthy complaint with a court in New York. Within it, Kering gives the example of a merchant that has used Taobao to \"openly sell\" wholesale quantities of \"obviously fake Gucci products\". The merchant is said to have advertised a branded handbag for $2-$5 (£1.30-£3.20) per unit - with the price determined by the size of the order, which had to be a minimum of 2,000 bags. Kering notes that the bags are normally sold for $795 each. It also highlights that watches bearing Gucci's trademarked logo had been displayed when users searched for \"replica wristwatches\" on the site. \"[The merchant] sells its counterfeit watch for $10-$80 per piece,\" the complaint states. \"This seller requires a minimum purchase of 300 pieces per order and can supply up to 200,000 pieces per month. The authentic Gucci watch retails for $960.\" Kering alleges the two cases are part of a much bigger problem. \"These specifically identifiable counterfeit products could not be sold without their assistance, but instead of shutting down the counterfeiters, the Alibaba defendants seek to profit from the counterfeiters' blatant violations,\" it states. \"The Alibaba defendants knowingly assist these counterfeiters in virtually all aspects of their illegal operations.\" Counterfeit crackdown But during a recent conference call to bank analysts, Alibaba insisted it was enforcing a \"zero tolerance policy\" towards fakes. \"We conduct periodic checks by using third parties to identify suspected counterfeit products on our marketplaces,\" said Joe Tsai, the firm's vice-chairman. \"[And] when we receive complaints or allegations regarding infringement for counterfeit groups, we follow well-developed procedures to take strict action. \"If allegations are posting or selling counterfeit products are substantiated, we penalise the parties involved through a number of means, including enforcing the seller to reimburse the buyer, assessing penalties against the seller by limiting their ability to add listings, adopting a name-and-shame policy and closing down store fronts and permanently banning the seller from establishing another store front.\" More recently, the firm has announced a tie-up with an Israeli start-up to offer visual markers - similar to but less obtrusive than QR codes - that can be scanned with its Taobao app to prove that goods are genuine. Manufacturers are being invited to add the \"dotless visual codes\" to their labels to help prove they are authentic.",

One analyst said Three's pricing had \"undercut\" rivals Vodafone and EE. Both have already launched a 5G service in some major cities but Three will not launch its service until August. As well as faster download speeds, one of the benefits of 5G is increased network capacity. In theory, it should mean an end to network congestion in busy areas such as pop concerts or festivals. EE launched its 5G service in May. Currently its cheapest Sim-only 5G tariff costs £32 a month, but it comes with a 20GB data download cap. Vodafone offers a Sim-only tariff for £23 a month, but limits the download speed to 2 Mbps, making it slower than 4G. It charges £30 a month for true full-speed 5G.

The network told the BBC there was \"absolutely no throttling\". \"Our 5G is completely unrestricted and there no catches,\" a spokeswoman said. On Monday, Three was criticised after it refused calls from the industry regulator Ofcom to automatically cut its customers' monthly charge at the end of their contract's lock-in period. As a result, Ofcom said Three's subscribers would \"overpay\" unless they took action to change to another deal. \"The UK is rapidly becoming the most competitive market for 5G and Three's announcement raises the ante once again,\" said Kester Mann, an analyst at the CCS Insight consultancy. \"It is surely only a matter of time before all four UK operators offer unlimited 5G data.\" Mr Mann said 5G was \"crucial\" for Three because it provided \"an opportunity to reinvigorate the brand, overcome a negative network perception [and] achieve the scale it has long-for craved\".

If shareholders vote in favour of the motion, Apple may have to explain its responses to future demands from governments that limit free expression.

Some viewed the location app as a way for protesters to stay safe, while others saw it as a way to avoid the police. Apple said the app \"facilitated, enabled or encouraged\" activity that was not legal. However, the app is still available on Google's app store. Apple never disclosed whether the ban came after a request from Chinese authorities. SumofUs argues that Apple's actions have resulted in the persecution of certain ethnicities. \"By complying with the government of China's regime, Apple is aiding the brutal repression of Uighurs, Tibetans and other rights activists,\" said Ms Gupta. \"Our motion would force Apple to stand accountable for the impact of its decisions on the lives of innocent people.\" Analysts from online stockbroker AJ Bell said: \"Shareholders tend not to vote in favour of motions like this, mainly because the majority of votes are from institutional investors who have greater access to management and hence are more likely to deal with such questions behind closed doors.\" In May, Amazon shareholders voted down proposals intended to cut sales of the company's controversial facial-recognition tool and to reduce its carbon output.",

Apple appealed earlier this month to block the resolution, but the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected this."

		"InputText": "Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we look at the fallout from the cancellation of Mobile World Congress - and ask whether social media has played a positive or negative role in helping people understand the threat posed by the virus. We've been in California this week - the podcast was recorded from the studios of KQED in San Francisco - and we've watched as the tech industry here has tried to get to grips with the threat posed by the coronavirus. At the beginning of the week, while major players like Ericsson and LG had pulled out of MWC, the general mood seemed to be that the show would go ahead. We took a trip across the Bay Bridge to Berkeley in search of some expertise. Fear spreads faster than infection There we found Dr Lee Riley, professor of infectious diseases and vaccinology at the University of California - a man who has spent his career studying epidemics, including a spell at the World Health Organization. He was surprisingly sanguine about the coronavirus, pointing out that common-or-garden influenza was far more deadly, though he said he understood that uncertainty about the nature of the disease was bound to make people fearful. But he said a 24/7 news culture and the rise of social media made that fear spread faster than the virus itself - especially as the coronavirus was being diagnosed far more rapidly than Sars was 20 years ago. \"They do the diagnosis, and then we hear about the news of the diagnosis right away throughout the world instantaneously. They're constantly getting updates on this... and I think that feeds into some of the anxiety that people have.\" Social media was giving people partial information, but not all the facts, and that magnified their concerns. He seemed surprised when we told him there was talk of cancelling Mobile World Congress. He said that would be an \"over-reaction\". Even if people were attending the show from China, he said, \"we have new ways to diagnose these types of infections very quickly and accurately so that shouldn't be a concern.\" Feeling the heat at Samsung The following day, the mobile industry's market leader Samsung was launching its latest devices in San Francisco. On our way into the event – which, like MWC, had attracted visitors from around the world – we had to walk past a temperature sensor to screen us for fever, a symptom of the coronavirus. Inside, there were plentiful supplies of face masks and hand sanitiser. Then we got to see a spectacular show where the flagship Galaxy S20, now with 5G across all its versions, was unveiled. Having been under pressure from China's Huawei, which seemed to be leading the way on camera innovation, Samsung showed off a combined optical and digital 100x zoom which allowed the phone to pick out the Palace of Fine Arts where the event was taking place from a vantage point miles away, overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. The star of the show, however, was Samsung's second folding phone the Galaxy Z Flip, a smaller and far more elegant device than last year's Galaxy Fold, even though the $1,380 (£1,058) price tag seems a bit steep just to be able to slip it into your jeans pocket. This was the second time Samsung had held its major event of the year before Mobile World Congress, previously the launch pad for its new Galaxy phones. Disappointment and disinformation That move looked even smarter the next day, when the news came through that MWC had been cancelled. That leaves its biggest Android rival Huawei with no venue to show off its latest devices - it had been planning to make a big splash in Barcelona. The leading analyst Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies, who is based in Silicon Valley, told us she was disappointed to be missing the show – an opportunity to get a global perspective on the industry. She made the point that a lot of the action takes place behind the scenes, with senior executives meeting and making deals. But the impact on the industry of cancelling the show was as nothing compared to the wider damage the virus could cause. \"It is nowhere near the impact that the coronavirus could actually have from a manufacturing perspective, from delaying products to lack of availability of products that are already in the market today,\" she said. Meanwhile, a World Health Organization official has been visiting the Silicon Valley tech giants this week to express concerns over the spread of misinformation about the coronavirus on social media. Standing outside Google's Mountain View headquarters, Andrew Pattison had this warning: \"The spread of misinformation, and false information about the virus itself is spread faster than the virus, and it's got into more people's lives and infected more people than the actual virus itself.\" Examples include people falsely claiming that eating garlic or taking vitamin C could ward off the disease, or changing credible websites such as that of the Canadian Health Ministry to insert false information about schools which had been affected by the coronavirus. But Mr Pattinson said there had been useful conversations with the tech firms, and Google had acted to remove misinformation from search results about the virus and replace it with content from reliable organisations such as the WHO. What is clear is that the coronavirus is going to have a major impact on many technology firms this year. Some will be trying to work out how to keep fragile supply chains intact as components from China become sparse. For others – notably the social media giants – the threat is of damage to their reputations if they are seen as the purveyors of panic and the channels for misinformation.",

		"InputText": "By Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation reporter, BBC News The adverts show the Democratic Party challenger with an earpiece, and say that he refused to have his ears checked for devices prior to the debate. The Biden campaign rejected the claims. The Trump campaign adverts ask: \"Why won't Sleepy Joe commit to an ear test?\" and \"Who is in Joe's ear?\" Accusations that presidential candidates have received debate help via hidden hearing devices are familiar, albeit unproven. Such allegations have been levelled against both Republican and Democratic candidates in the past. Prior to Tuesday's debate, the rumour about Mr Biden's supposed earpiece was circulating on several social networks, and was being promoted by the Trump campaign. At least 15 versions The advertising campaign was launched after the debate, and also promotes two other baseless but widely shared rumours about Mr Biden. One suggested he asked for breaks during the debate, and another accused him of refusing a \"drug test\". The photo featured in the advert is not from Tuesday's debate. It was first shared online in September 2019. In a number of the adverts, it has been doctored to show Mr Biden wearing wireless Apple headphones. This was not the case in the original image. Some versions circle the ear featuring the headphone. By Wednesday evening, there were at least 15 different versions of the advert, and according to Facebook's Ad Library, they had reached at least 10 million users. Facebook has pledged to label posts containing voting misinformation and point users towards accurate information ahead of the election. However its policy does not involve fact-checking political speech, including in advertisements. The company declined to comment about the latest Trump ad campaign. Rumour origins Hours before the debate, the claims went viral on Facebook and YouTube. Identical memes were pushed by a number of popular Facebook pages with names such as US Conservative and Unhinged Left. They claimed \"Joe Biden should be inspected for a hidden earpiece as well as submit to a drug test before the debate\". These memes are subject to fact-checks - and some have had warning labels applied to them on Facebook. The claims were picked up by Fox News and other conservative news outlets. They were further amplified by supporters of QAnon, an unfounded a conspiracy theory that claims President Trump is fighting a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles. Those who believe in QAnon are known for promoting political disinformation on social media which targets opponents of the president. They shared close-up pictures of Mr Biden's ears, alleging a listening device was visible. During the debate, some also shared photos of a fold in Mr Biden's shirt, claiming it was caused by a wire, and of a supposed device on his wrist, where he wears a rosary in memory of his late son Beau. Nothing new Conspiracy theories about secret listening devices have been recycled in presidential election campaigns for the past two decades. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton faced similar unfounded claims ahead of the 2016 presidential election. In 2004, rumours circulated among left-wing sites and blogs that President George W Bush was being aided by a secret earpiece. None of those allegations were found to be true. Even if a candidate did wear an earpiece, any advantage would be questionable. As TV and radio presenters can attest, listening to someone while simultaneously talking during the back-and-forth of a live event is a difficult skill to master.",

But the unions say members are being \"robbed\" and will have to pay more and work longer for lower pensions. Meanwhile, walkouts by prison service staff in England, Wales and Scotland have now ended. Among the public sector workers taking part in the 24-hour strike are civil servants, NHS workers - including paramedics - border force staff and lecturers. Around 32,000 police officers took part in a protest march against cuts, according to Metropolitan Police estimates. Union leaders say up to 400,000 workers are on strike, while Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude puts the total number of public sector workers who joined strikes at \"close to 150,000\" which includes 102,244 civil servants. Mr Maude also said pension talks will not be reopened and \"nothing further will be achieved through strike action\", adding that it is \"now time that union leaders put the best interests of their members first by asking them to accept our generous offer\". Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS union - which estimates that an \"overwhelming majority\" of its 250,000 public sector members are on strike - said the UK would have \"the highest pension age of any European country\". He added: \"We're going to be paying more money when the cost of pensions are falling and our members have had a pay freeze for two years. So it's unfair, and ministers cannot justify the changes.\" The government plans to raise the retirement age in line with the state pension age - eventually to rise to 68. But Conservative Party chairman Lady Warsi told BBC News that workers were being asked to \"to work a little bit longer and to pay a bit more, but they will be guaranteed a pension which is index-linked and inflation proof\". Strike action includes: The Cabinet Office says UK border controls have been managed \"without delays\". The Prison Officers Association (POA) instructed its members to provide only minimum cover to preserve health and safety within jails in England and Wales from 07:00 BST on Thursday. The Ministry of Justice warned that it faced a possible injunction against its actions, but by mid-afternoon the union instructed its members to return to work. It also says 80% of its members at jails in England, Wales and Scotland took part. The POA says the nationwide protests by its officers \"achieved their objective in sending clear message to government that prison officers should not be working until the age of 68\" and that their return to work was not prompted by the threat of an injunction. The union's general secretary, Steve Gillan, also said it was not ruling out further action in future. 'Ultimate public service' Government proposals to be considered in Parliament - as featured in the Public Service Pensions Bill detailed in the Queen's Speech on Wednesday - seek substantially increased employee contributions. As well as increasing the retirement age, the government also proposes that final-salary schemes will eventually be replaced by less generous career-average schemes. In a central London march, thousands of off-duty officers took part in the biggest police rally since a 2008 protest against a pay award imposed by the Labour government. Organiser the Police Federation said its members - who are prevented by law from taking industrial action - were protesting against a reduction in the number of officers, a lack of consultation over plans for reform, and pay and pensions. The federation's PC Julie Nesbitt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the police service is \"the people without whom the rest of the public services shouldn't function and therefore we should be treated according to that\". 'Too fast' Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, who marched with police officers at a separate protest, said 16,000 were being lost across the country which was \"irresponsible and taking a risk with crime\". Home Secretary Theresa May told the Commons police officers will still be \"well remunerated\" and receive \"very good\" pensions after government reforms are brought in. \"I see an exciting future for policing as a result of the reforms that this government is putting through and that is the message I hope everybody will be taking out to police officers on the streets,\" she said. The unions taking part on Thursday are: the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), the largest civil service trade union; Unite, representing NHS workers, Ministry of Defence firefighters and others; the University and College Union; the Immigration Services Union; Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union members in the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, and the Northern Ireland Public Services Alliance.",

		"InputText": "Mr Entwistle, who had been in the job for just 54 days, resigned on 10 November after a row over Newsnight. A Newsnight report had led to Thatcher-era Tory Lord McAlpine being wrongly accused of child abuse. The programme had previously shelved a sex abuse investigation into BBC TV presenter and DJ Jimmy Savile. Lord Patten, appearing before the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said Mr Entwistle had asked him if the BBC Trust - the corporation's governing body - was \"urging him to go\". He was told: \"We are not urging you to go. But we are not urging you to stay.\" Lord Patten said Mr Entwistle and his lawyers insisted he would not leave with six months pay and he said the director general had asked for more than the 12 months pay he eventually got. \"He wanted to go on 12 months and more,\" he told the committee. Questioned about how much Mr Entwistle had asked for, he said: \"He didn't ask for two years but he did ask for more.\" Lord Patten said there had been feverish negotiation on 11 November and he took advice from the BBC's lawyers. He said they told him that if the pay-off deal was refused, Mr Entwistle could go to an industrial tribunal and would stand to win an extra £80,000 on top of the £450,000. Lord Patten said: \"We did not have grounds for dismissal. We could either accept a consensual deal for 12 months, or the situation would drift on and we would find ourselves with a constructive dismissal (claim) and also an unfair dismissal.\" He also said that if Mr Entwistle was found to have done anything in breach of his contract, \"we can claw back some of the remunerations that has been paid\". 'Decent man' Referring to Mr Entwistle, Lord Patten said he refused to \"trash a decent man\" who had been \"overwhelmed\" by events. He added that he \"wondered by the end of it how much his heart was in it. I think he found the whole thing an appalling experience\". Earlier, Lord Patten told the MPs the BBC must not \"abandon or resign from investigative journalism\" because of the mistakes made by Newsnight. He said there was a need for a \"belt and braces\" approach to make sure such \"shoddy journalism\" was not repeated. But he added: \"The BBC must not abandon or resign from investigative journalism. It's important that your journalistic standards are even higher for investigative journalism.\" Some of the other key exchanges included: The BBC has been mired in controversy since October - on 2 October, Newsnight editor Peter Rippon blogged about why an investigation into sex abuse allegations involving former BBC DJ and television presenter Savile had been shelved in December 2011. The following day ITV aired a documentary which included serious allegations about the presenter, who died in October 2011. This led to a stream of allegations about Savile's behaviour during the 1970s, 80s and 90s, when he was a household name in Britain as the presenter of the BBC's Jim'll Fix It. On 2 November, Newsnight aired a programme in which Steve Messham, a former resident of the Bryn Estyn children's home in Wrexham, claimed he had been abused by an unnamed senior politician of the Thatcher era at the home. It subsequently emerged he had wrongly identified to Newsnight the former Conservative Party treasurer, Lord McAlpine, as being one of his abusers. Although Lord McAlpine was not named in the programme, his name emerged on the internet and he then came out in public to angrily deny being involved. A BBC inquiry later said some of the basic journalistic checks had not been completed; identification was not confirmed by photograph with Mr Messham, and no right of reply was offered to Lord McAlpine. And the BBC paid £185,000 in libel damages to the peer. Last week Tony Hall, a former BBC news executive who spent the last decade running the Royal Opera House, agreed to become the next director general early next year. Lord Patten said he was \"greatly looking forward\" to working with Lord Hall. He said: \"The biggest task we face is restoring trust. Trust in the BBC has taken a knock. \"The BBC is still trusted more than any news organisation but that is not a statement of complacency because we have shot ourselves in the foot. We have to rebuild that trust.\" For his part, Mr Davie said the BBC needed to be more transparent and \"slightly more humble\".",

Mr Magag, 28, of Somali origin, was last seen in north London. He is subject to a TPim control measure, which controversially replaced Labour control orders a year ago. TPims - or Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures - restrict the movements of people thought to pose a risk to the public, but who cannot be tried for reasons of national security and who cannot be deported. Those subject to such orders face restrictions, such as where they stay, who they contact, and where they travel, but differ from control orders in that suspects cannot be forced to relocate to more isolated parts of the UK. During her urgent Commons question, Labour's Yvette Cooper - the shadow home secretary - asked Mrs May whether in \"ditching\" relocation she had \"personally made it easier\" for terror suspects to abscond. Black cab She said: \"Magag is still missing after 13 days. Clearly the home secretary has no idea where he is. \"You must not ignore the evidence on relocations now. Isn't it time you took some responsibility and sorted this mess out?\" Ms Cooper also asked whether the home secretary could confirm whether Mr Magag had escaped his surveillance team by simply getting into a black cab in London's Triton Street. The home secretary refused to confirm this. Mrs May said that under Labour's control orders, seven terror suspects had absconded and only one of them had been found. She insisted the disappearance of Mr Magag did not pose a terror threat, saying: \"The government does not believe Magag's disappearance is linked to any current terrorism planning in the UK. \"Nevertheless, we are of course taking this matter very seriously. The police are doing everything in their power to apprehend Magag as quickly as possible.\" Mr Magag was reported as missing after he failed to report to his overnight residence on 26 December. He was last seen in Camden at 17:20 GMT the same day. On 31 December, an anonymity order was lifted, allowing him to be indentified to aid the police search. Forged passports Mr Magag had previously been subject to a control order and forced to live in south-west England, but was allowed to return to London under the terms of his TPim. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, told the Commons he understood Mr Magag had forged passports when in Somalia, and asked Mrs May whether Mr Magag was in possession of his passport when he went missing. The home secretary said she had to consult the details of a previous anonymity order before answering his question.

		"InputText": "The Information Commissioner is to be asked to overrule a decision by the National Archives to keep the documents about the trial of Stephen Ward hidden. The submission is being made by lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC. It is believed Ward killed himself as his trial for living off immoral earnings was ending. Ward, an artist and osteopath living in London, had in 1961 introduced 21-year-old reputed call girl Christine Keeler to the Secretary of State for War, John Profumo. The minister and Ms Keeler - who is also thought to have had relations with an attache at the Russian embassy, Yevgeny Ivanov - started an affair. When challenged, Profumo initially denied the relationship - but was later forced to admit that he had lied in March 1963, in a scandal that threatened to topple the Conservative government of the time. Ward, who many believe was a victim of a cover-up, is understood to have killed himself on the last day of his trial at the Old Bailey, where he was found guilty of living off the immoral earnings of Ms Keeler and her friend Mandy Rice-Davies, who were referred to at the time of the court case as prostitutes. Mr Robertson, the author of Stephen Ward was Innocent, OK, said that he was making the appeal because keeping documents about Ward's trial hidden \"was irrational and ignores the public interest and the interests of history in discovering the truth about Ward's conviction, which is widely viewed as a miscarriage of justice\". 'Scapegoat' He added: \"Releasing the official trial transcript is important to work out why Ward was ever prosecuted, and it will assist the case for overturning his conviction.\" The National Archives refused Mr Robertson access to most of its file on Ward, which is believed to include the police statements used to charge him with living off the earnings of Ms Keeler and Ms Rice-Davies. Mr Robertson argues in his book that neither woman was a prostitute, and both in fact lived off Ward's earnings as a celebrated osteopath and portrait artist. The file on Ward is currently closed from public view until 2046, because this is 100 years after the birth of Ms Rice-Davies, the youngest of the trial witnesses. The Information Commissioner is set to make a decision to see if it can be opened earlier. According to Mr Robertson, this \"will cast an important new light on one of the worst miscarriages of justice in modern British history, and help explain how Stephen Ward was made the scapegoat for the Profumo affair by prosecuting him for crimes that neither he nor anyone else ever committed\". A spokesman for the National Archives said it did not want to provide a comment. A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it had not yet received Mr Robertson's submission.",

The knighthood for Sir Rod, whose own stellar career has seen him sell more than 100 million records over six decades, is for services to music and charity. \"Forces sweetheart\" Dame Vera Lynn joins the elite Companions of Honour in recognition of her services to entertainment and charity. And Downton Abbey actress Penelope Wilton is made a dame for services to drama. There are CBEs for England cricket captain Alastair Cook, former footballer Alan Shearer and broadcaster Janet Street-Porter, and OBEs for TV presenters Ant and Dec and actor Brian Blessed. Twelve famous faces in Birthday Honours In pictures: Entertainment figures on list Dame Vera Lynn 'surprised' by accolade The lists in full 'Most diverse' The UK's first official astronaut, Maj Peake is due to return to Earth this month after a six-month mission and said he was \"honoured to receive the first appointment to the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George for extraordinary service beyond our planet\". The honour is usually given for \"serving the UK abroad\". Stewart, 71 - now officially Sir Roderick - said: \"I've led a wonderful life and have had a tremendous career thanks to the generous support of the great British public. This monumental honour has topped it off and I couldn't ask for anything more.\" Of the 1,149 people recognised on the list, 70% are being honoured for work in their communities, either in a voluntary or paid capacity. The youngest person on the list is 21-year-old apprentice Gary Doyle, who receives a British Empire Medal (BEM) after taking gold at the World Skills event for his \"extraordinary plumbing and heating prowess\". The Cabinet Office said it was the \"most diverse\" since the Order of the British Empire was founded in 1917. Women make up 47% of the total, 8.2% are from a black and minority ethnic background and 5.2% consider themselves to have a disability. However, Vote Leave has accused David Cameron of \"abusing the honours system\" - pointing out 22 prominent supporters of the campaign to remain in the EU are on the list, which goes to the prime minister for approval. But a government spokesman said the honours were unconnected to the EU referendum, adding the names were selected by independent committees \"well before\" the date of the vote had been announced, and also included prominent supporters from the Leave side. Ordinary lads' Dame Vera, 99, whose songs buoyed the spirits of millions during World War Two, said: \"I felt very greatly honoured to be given a damehood and never expected to receive anything else.\" Also becoming a Companion of Honour is Lord Smith of Kelvin. A former BBC governor, he has overseen the process of devolving more powers to Scotland, and is recognised for his public service. The OBEs for Britain's Got Talent hosts Ant and Dec - Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly - are for services to broadcasting and entertainment. In a joint statement, they said they were \"shocked but incredibly honoured\". Describing themselves as \"two ordinary lads from the west end of Newcastle\" they added: \"This will definitely be the proudest our mams have ever been.\" Among the others from the world of entertainment is actor and BBC radio presenter Adil Ray, the creator of TV comedy Citizen Khan, who becomes an OBE. 'Bittersweet' There are 13 new dames on the list. They include Louise Casey, who has undertaken high-profile work for successive governments on issues including anti-social behaviour. Her honour comes for services to families and vulnerable people. Last year Dame Louise produced a report into child sex abuse in Rotherham. Youth worker Jayne Senior, who said the report vindicated her efforts to help expose the scandal, is appointed MBE for services to child protection in Rotherham. Her inclusion on the list was \"bittersweet\", she said, because it came in the wake of so many \"ruined and devastated\" young lives. One of the world's leading experts in forensic anthropology, Prof Sue Black from Dundee University, said she was \"more than a little embarrassed\" to receive a damehood for services to her profession. \"However, it is certainly always encouraging for me... to receive recognition because everything we do reflects on the team,\" she said. Rotha Johnston has been made a dame for services to the Northern Ireland economy and her role promoting female entrepreneurship through the Northern Ireland Women's Network. Among the 19 men given knighthoods are Damon Buffini - recently appointed chairman of the National Theatre - for voluntary and charitable services, and artist Michael Craig-Martin for services to art. In the year that marks the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, Prof Stanley Wells, scholar and honorary president of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, is knighted for services to scholarship. Prof Doug Turnbull, the doctor behind a ground-breaking IVF technique which prevents disabling genetic disorders from being passed on to future generations, also becomes a sir. Knighthoods for political service go to Democratic Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson; Tory MP Desmond Swayne, the International Development Minister; former Labour MP David Hamilton, and former Conservative MSP Alex Fergusson, Former miner Sir David spent two months in prison during the industry's strike in the 1980s before later being cleared of assault. He later served as MP for Midlothian for 14 years. Sir Alex was a champion of rural affairs during his 17 years at Holyrood, and his knighthood also acknowledges his work in the Scottish parliamentary process and public life in Scotland. 'Very average' The CBE for England cricket captain Cook, who recently became the youngest player to score 10,000 Test runs, is for services to the game, while his teammate Stuart Broad becomes an MBE. Former Newcastle and England footballer Shearer, who is appointed CBE for charitable services to the community in north-east England, joins several other sporting names on the list. These include Chelsea Ladies FC manager Emma Hayes (MBE), rugby referee Nigel Owens (MBE) and Davis Cup tennis players Jamie Murray and Leon Smith (OBEs). Smith, who led Great Britain to a first title Davis Cup title since 1936, said he started out as a \"very average\" tennis player, and described his honour as \"humbling\". Martine Wiltshire, a Team GB sitting volleyball player and Paralympian, who lost both her legs in the London 7/7 bombings, is appointed MBE for services to sport. Hayley Turner, the most successful female jockey in British history, is appointed OBE for services to horse racing following her retirement from the sport last year. There is also a CBE for Prof Laura Jean McAllister, chairman of Sport Wales. The honours system Commonly awarded ranks: Guide to the honours From the business world, Simon Duffy and Rhodri Ferrier, co-founders of men's skincare brand Bulldog, become MBEs, while Alex Chesterman, co-founder of property search website Zoopla becomes an OBE. MBEs also go to Martin Dickie and James Watt, co-founders of Aberdeenshire-based craft beer company BrewDog. It is a double celebration for Mr Watt as his illustrator wife Johanna Basford has been appointed OBE for services to art and entrepreneurship. Meanwhile, Eben Upton, pioneer of the Raspberry Pi bare-bones computer, becomes a CBE. The same honour goes to Peter Davies, former commissioner of Sustainable Futures in Wales. Gary Etchells, a Police Community Support Officer, who was stabbed in the neck in the line of duty in Greater Manchester, becomes an MBE for services to policing. A CBE for Adrian Leppard, lately commissioner, City of London Police, recognises his policing career and efforts to tackle economic crime. Margaret Calvert, who helped design the signage system for the UK road network in the late 1950s, is appointed OBE. She was responsible for several pictograms, including the \"children crossing\" sign.

		"InputText": "After fighting the battle at a London employment tribunal, former driver and GMB union branch secretary Steve Garelick said he was \"beside himself with joy\". The ruling found drivers for the cab service should not be treated as self-employed and have the same working rights as other staff. And although the case focused on Uber, Mr Garelick believed it would not just be drivers who saw the benefits. \"This is for anyone who works in this type of economy,\" said Mr Garelick. \"You could be a cleaner that works through an app, but now you have the right to a quality of life. \"It is so important to workers. I think what we have done here is ensure employment rights for the future. I couldn't be happier.\" 'Major implications' Uber has more than 30,000 drivers across the UK who it described as \"independent contractors\" or self-employed. Bosses of the mobile app company, which lets customers order taxis over their smartphones, said their status did not entitle them to the benefits of employees and is to appeal against the decision of the tribunal. But the drivers said they were being treated unlawfully. The Central London Employment Tribunal ruled in the drivers favour, with the GMB union saying that outcome of the case could have \"major\" implications for other staff at the firm. One of the drivers who took the case up in court was James Farrar. Averaging just £5.03 an hour when working over the summer, the London driver said his finances were \"really starting to bite\" without the security of employed workers' rights. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show before the ruling Mr Farrar said: \"If you want to cover your costs and keep the family afloat, you have got to work a lot of hours with Uber. \"You can turn on the app and work whenever you want. You can stop whenever you want and go home. The only problem is that if you are not working, you are not earning, and the earnings are so much lower than I expected. \"It's well below minimum wage.\" Khaled Mohamed-Hadg, who drives for Uber in London, said he will be following Mr Farrar's suit and taking up his case with the GMB as well. \"I am very happy with this decision,\" he said. \"It is very important, because we are happy to play our part in helping the economy, but we want to be treated fairly and paid fairly. \"If you drive so much because you earn so little, if its bad for your health. I know people who drive 12 or 15 hours a day to make the money and don't even make minimum wage, so this could make all the difference to them. How the case unfolded... This summer, two Uber drivers took the company to an employment tribunal with the help of the GMB Union. James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam argued that they were \"employed\" by Uber, which under employment law would entitle them to certain rights, including sick and holiday pay. But the company insists it was simply a technology platform that links supply with demand - in this case the supply of self-employed drivers with demand for cabs. After deliberating over the case, the employment tribunal in London ruled in favour of the drivers, agreeing they should be treated as employees and entitled to all the workers' rights that go with it. A further 17 claims have been brought against Uber, according to law firm Leigh Day, which are likely to be decided on this ruling. Uber is to appeal against the decision. New business model Another Uber driver, Asif Hanif, said it was not just about the cash but workers' rights. Reacting to the ruling, he said Uber should meet any financial implications from the ruling from its profits - and not pass on price rises to drivers or passengers. Mr Hanif said once his expenses are taken into consideration he does not earn the minimum wage. He said the rights of Uber drivers have \"long been denied\". Uber needed a business model that \"fits the British society and British economy\", he told the BBC. \"Flexibility does not mean that you can abuse the workforce because if these companies have come and operate in Britain then they have to respect the law of the land and they have to respect that Britain has enabled them to earn an enormous amount of the profit.\" He told the BBC: \"With Uber, even though they've said it's an app-based and we are self-employed, how could I be self-employed? \"When I open the app, then only I go online through Uber - I got the jobs through them, on their conditions.\" 'Dumbfounded' But Steven Rowe, who has driven using the Uber app for four years, considers himself a self-employed man and thought prices would go up if he was treated as an employee. After the ruling, he told BBC News: \"It was a perfect platform for me. It gave me the flexibility I wanted and when I wanted. \"It had never occurred to me in four years that I would be getting sick pay and leave. I don't see myself as employed, I don't see myself as working for Uber. I see myself as my own boss, making my own decisions and I can't believe this decision is being called a success for the drivers. \"The vast majority of us will be really, really worried if Uber can run in the very successful way it has been doing in this country.\"",

		"InputText": "Prof Paul Cosford, from Public Health England, told the BBC his teams were doing their best to contain the spread. But given there were now a number of \"countries of concern\", new cases were likely to be brought in by people travelling from abroad. A British man linked to 11 cases of coronavirus has now left hospital. Steve Walsh, 53, from Hove, has fully recovered and poses \"no risk to the public\", NHS England said. Twelve patients treated by two Brighton GPs diagnosed with coronavirus have now been contacted by health officials. All 83 people being held in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral, after being flown back from China, are free of the virus and will be able to leave their accommodation on Thursday morning. A total of 1,750 people have tested negative for the virus in the UK, with eight testing positive. Prof Cosford, emeritus medical director at PHE, said the biggest risk to the UK were the efforts in mainland China, which - if they don't succeed - could mean \"other countries then have widespread outbreaks of infection\". This could increase the risk of more widespread infection in the UK, he said. Identifying people quickly, tracing close contacts at risk of infection and keeping them in isolation was the main aim. And children did not need to be taken out of school and isolated unless \"we tell them that's what is needed\", Prof Cosford said. Steve Walsh was the third case to be confirmed in the UK, following two Chinese nationals testing positive in York. He was infected by the virus after attending a business conference in Singapore in January, and returned via France where he passed it unknowingly on to 11 other people - five of whom then returned to the UK. Mr Walsh, 53, from Hove, who had only mild symptoms, said he was now happy to be home and feeling well. \"I want to give a big thank you to the NHS who have been great throughout, and my thoughts are with everyone around the world who continues to be affected by the virus,\" Mr Walsh said. \"It's good to be back with my family and I would ask you please to respect our privacy from this point on.\" Brighton tracing The two Brighton GPs with coronavirus, who stayed in the same ski chalet in France as Mr Walsh, are now in isolation. The GP practices in Brighton where they worked have now reopened after a deep clean. Worthing Hospital, where one of the GPs worked a shift in A&E, continues to operate as normal, a Department of Health spokeswoman said. Patcham Nursing Home in Brighton, which was also visited by one of the GPs, is now open again to visitors. One of the Brighton doctors has been named as Catriona Greenwood. The second GP has not been named. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said the official name for the disease caused by the coronavirus is Covid-19. Prof Neil Ferguson, infectious disease expert from Imperial College London, told the BBC that he thought new cases of the virus could still rise. \"I think we're in the early phases of a global pandemic at the moment,\" he said. Prof Ferguson added it was likely that only one in three cases coming into the UK was being picked up. But John Oxford, emeritus professor of virology at Queen Mary University London, said he thought the virus had a weakness - and people's actions could help slow transmission. \"It's not about wearing a mask - it's less of the hand-shaking, touching and kissing,\" he said, speaking on the Today programme. What are the symptoms of coronavirus and what can help stop its spread? The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent hand washing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. Anyone experiencing symptoms, even if mild, after travelling from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau, is advised to stay indoors and call the NHS 111 phone service. On Monday, the government issued new powers in England to keep people in quarantine to stop the virus spreading. Under the Department of Health measures, people will not be free to leave quarantine and can be forcibly sent into isolation if they pose a threat. The BBC understands that two prisoners on a wing at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire have been tested for the virus. One of them, a remand prisoner, had recently returned to the UK from Thailand. The overall number of infections is more than 44,000 on mainland China, with cases in more than 20 countries. On Wednesday, around 300 employees were evacuated from Singapore's biggest bank, DBS, after one person fell ill with the virus. The Chinese Grand Prix - which had been scheduled for 19 April in Shanghai - has been postponed as a result of the outbreak. Have you been affected by any of the issues raised here?

He also admitted the attempted murders of John Collins, Michael Belcher and Ryan Pridding during the attack on Mark Short at a Droylsden pub in May 2012. He was cleared of a charge of attempted murder of Sharon Hark. Passing a whole-life sentence at Preston Crown Court, Mr Justice Holroyde QC said Cregan had had \"a cold-blooded and ruthless determination to end the lives of PCs Bone and Hughes\". \"You acted with premeditated savagery [and] drew those two officers into a calculated trap to kill them,\" he said. Decade-long feud Four other men were jailed for their parts in the killings of David and Mark Short and one further man was jailed for assisting an offender. The murder of Mark Short at the Cotton Tree Inn by Cregan, Luke Livesey and Damian Gorman came after a decade-long feud between families. Following the death, Cregan, Anthony Wilkinson and Jermaine Ward killed Mark Short's father David in a gun and grenade attack. With the help of Mohammed Imran Ali, the three then went on the run. Cregan later lured PCs Hughes and Bone to their deaths before handing himself in to police. Livesey, 28, and Gorman, 38, were each jailed for 33 years for the murder of Mark Short and the three attempted murders at the Cotton Tree Inn in Droylsden. Wilkinson, 34, and Ward, 24, were jailed for 35 years and 33 years respectively for killing David Short at his Clayton home in August. Ali, 32, was jailed for seven years for assisting an offender. In a statement delivered outside court, Nicola Hughes' family said they would live with what Cregan did \"every single hour of every single day for the rest of our lives\". \"He has lost nothing. He had already committed two murders and was destined for a lifetime behind bars. \"He chose on that day to murder our daughter and leave our lives completely devastated - a life barely worth living without her.\" Fiona Bone's father Paul said he had been told \"it gets easier in time but at this moment, every Tuesday lunchtime is difficult as that is when our lives changed forever\". \"Yes we have regrets that Fiona was taken from us but we have no regrets that she was a police officer with Greater Manchester Police and we're extremely proud of her life and achievements,\" he said.

We are not happy with the total outcome of the verdicts.\" 'Rots in hell' The Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Sir Peter Fahy said his officers still felt a \"huge sense of loss\" at the \"brutal murders\" of their colleagues. He added: \"I have no feelings for Dale Cregan and what he has done, I'm pleased that he will be locked up for the rest of his life. \"The Home Secretary has given a guarantee on that and I expect other future home secretaries to honour that guarantee.\" Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said all four murders had been \"nothing short of executions - planned, premeditated and cold-blooded\". Ian Hanson, chairman of the Greater Manchester Police Federation, said: \"I have no problem whatsoever with the thought of him staring through one eye at a locked cell door wondering what kind of life he is missing and after he has stopped being a drain on society he can rot in hell. \"Dale Cregan wanted to be a big man, a hero.

Karen Fisher, executive director of human resources for the trust, said: \"Jeremy Pemberton's offer of employment was subject to an approved licence from the Church of England and authorisation from the interim Bishop of Nottingham and Southwell. \"This licence was not granted and regrettably the trust has withdrawn the offer of employment.\" Mr Pemberton said he was \"very, very disappointed\" at the situation and pointed out the church's attitude was \"inconsistent\", as he was still allowed to work in Lincolnshire. But a spokesperson for the Archbishops' Council said it would not comment on individual decisions made by diocese. They added: \"The Church of England is made up of 42 dioceses. \"Each diocese is autonomous with the diocesan bishop overseeing and taking a lead in its ministry and mission.\" The Reverend Colin Coward, director of Changing Attitude, a group which campaigns for LGBT rights within the Church of England, said: \"This treatment of Jeremy is unhealthy and intolerable. \"The two different ways he has been treated by two diocese reflects a deep split in the council of bishops and if the church continues to ignore this it will provoke more anger, of which there is a huge amount already.\"",

		"InputText": "Tahir Khan, 44, Sophia Ahmed, 39, and Omar Khan, 27, underwent the surgery after a series of tests at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Their mother and sister both died from stomach cancer. The siblings, from Walsall, said the operation had saved their lives and \"eliminated\" the risk. However, Tahir's daughter has now been found to have the same gene. The siblings' mother Pearl Khan was 49 when she died 16 years ago, six months after she was diagnosed. Their 32-year-old sister Yasmin Khan died about six years ago. Tahir said: \"We didn't even think about genetic testing at that time but Sophia was very tenacious and worked with Cancer Research UK to get us all tested.\" The screening and tests for all four of the remaining siblings, including their other sister Tracy Ismail, 49, took from about 12 months to three years. 'Totally devastated' They identified three of them were carriers and each decided to undergo the operation as a preventative measure. Sophia had the operation first, followed by Tahir and Omar. Tracy, who was the only sibling to find out she did not have the gene, said: \"They told me my results first, so I just thought we would all be the same. \"It was very bittersweet. I was totally devastated. \"At one point we were told that if we hadn't had the testing done, I'd be the only sibling left. \"Knowing what my mum and sister had gone through and so quickly, I encouraged them to have the procedure done, and they're all still here.\" Sophia said: \"I read in my sister Yasmin's notes in hospital that they thought it may be genetic so I did some research and found out the hospital in Cambridge was doing a study with Cancer Research so I contacted them and went from there. \"Everyone thought I was mad until we had the results come back and when we saw it was three of us out of the four, I knew it was worth it.\" Sophia said she can \"still eat and do everything\" and added: \"The only issue is maintaining my weight and my vitamin deficiencies but in comparison to having stomach cancer and a few years to live, I can't complain. \"I even had a baby after the operation, they thought I might be malnourished or the baby would be tiny, but everything was absolutely fine.\" How can you have your stomach removed? Cancer Research UK said some tests are available for an inherited faulty gene that can increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Tests for gastric cancer can include a blood test and chest X-ray, faecal sample testing, an endoscopy, ultrasound scan and laparoscopy. A gastrectomy is the name of the procedure of removing part or all of the stomach. During the procedure, a small pouch is created by connecting the gullet to either the small intestine or the remaining section of stomach. This means that the patient will still have a working digestive system, although it will not function as well as it did before. For about two weeks after the operation patients are fed through a tube into the vein, but eventually will be able to eat most foods and liquids. However, people who have had the procedure will need to eat more frequently and smaller portions, rather than three large meals a day, and take vitamin supplements to get the right amount of nutrition. Now, the food the siblings eat goes into a \"small pouch\" that was made by connecting the oesophagus to the intestine. \"I used to be 15st but now I'm only just over 10,\" Tahir said. \"I have to graze constantly because my body just can't get the nutrients it needs otherwise. \"My brother, on the other hand, he still eats like a horse.\" 'Best decision' Omar has a different view of the procedure. He said: \"At first after everything with my mum and sister I didn't want anything to do with hospitals or doctors or anything like that. \"But seeing my Sophia go through the procedure and have a baby afterwards, I thought 'I've got no excuse'. \"It was a really hard decision for me but it was the best one I've ever made. \"I still can eat whatever I like - burgers, steaks - the only thing I get is exhaustion and cold sweats but I'm still breathing and I'm so thankful for that.\" However, Tahir's daughter, Farah, who is 21, has since tested positive for the gene too. He said: \"I am worried about my daughter's future, but I say to her we have all gone through it and are fine now, so whatever happens she'll be OK.\" Tahir underwent his surgery five and a half years ago after his test found he had clusters of cancerous cells in his stomach lining. \"They said I effectively had cancer but because it was contained in my stomach lining and I had all that removed, it eliminated it. I could have had only days, weeks, maybe a year maximum left before I would have been diagnosed with terminal cancer. \"There's no doubt in my mind that having the tests and the procedure done saved my life.\" Dr Marc Tischkowitz, consultant physician in medical genetics at the University of Cambridge, said: \"This is a very rare, specific type of stomach cancer. \"It's a gene that carriers can have for their lifetime and means that they are at risk of developing cancer any time.\" He said the stomach removal was \"a dramatic life-changing procedure\" and said there was \"no way of knowing in all cases that the person who carries the gene will 100% have developed cancer in their lifetime\". Georgina Hill, from Cancer Research UK, said: \"It's estimated only 3-10% of cancer cases are linked to an inherited faulty gene. \"Anyone worried about their genetic cancer risk should talk to their doctor, who can refer those with a strong family history of certain cancers to a genetic counselling clinic if appropriate.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, and sign up for local news updates direct to your phone.",

The production of new 4x4s with the Defender's familiar shape - set to cost about £200,000 - is due to start at Derbyshire company Bowler Motorsport. Enthusiasts said they would be the \"best-ever\" Defender-style car but beyond the wallets of ordinary fans. Richard Smith, from the Association of Land Rover Clubs, said: \"Bowler are synonymous with building racing vehicles and it's great they are retaining the original shape. \"It's going to be a specialist car that's out of the price range of most people but I think it will win a lot of fans and it's really good for the region.\" A spokesperson for the Leicestershire-based Viking 4x4 Club added: \"The general consensus is that it's the best version of a Defender ever but none of our members are wealthy enough to afford it. \"Even if they could, they'd be scared to use it off-road because they wouldn't want to scratch or damage such an expensive vehicle.\" Motoring journalist Quentin Willson said: \"It's great the silhouette of the Defender lives on. \"It was one of the most recognisable shapes of any car in the world. \"It's also great that it's a Derbyshire-based company and they will be made just up the road [from where JLR is based]. \"It's horrendously expensive but it's bespoke and there's a lot of clever ingenuity in it.\" Belper-based Bowler, which was founded in 1985, was granted the licence for the shape by JLR, after being bought by the company in 2019. It said the vehicles - codenamed CSP 575 - which will include a supercharged engine and a high-strength chassis, will be available from 2021. Calum McKechnie, Bowler's general manager, said: \"We specialise in designing and engineering vehicles for specialist rally events and there's a huge amount of heritage events within Derbyshire.\" He added it was exciting to use \"that historic and iconic shape that everybody loves\". In 2019, JLR announced it would build its next-generation Defenders in Slovakia. Michael van der Sande, the managing director of JLR's Special Vehicle Operations, said the firm was \"excited\" to announce its first major project since its purchase of Bowler.

Children as far away as north America and Singapore took part in the Saturday night camp-out. By Sunday Max had raised more than £500,000 for charity. The money will be donated to the North Devon Hospice which helped Max's family care for their neighbour Rick Abbott - the man who provided the tent - before he died in February 2020. Max's mother Rachael Woosey said they had received \"hundreds of messages\" and believed about a thousand people took part in the camp-out.

Many children braved wind and rain through the night while others enjoyed the comfort of their living rooms instead. David Preston from South Staffordshire said his two children had popcorn in their tent, which had been put up in the front room. \"The children decided to do it after seeing Max on the news one evening... they where hardly roughing it like Max.

Shaz, 18, who was cared for by non-Muslims, told the BBC: \"I felt like I didn't belong and I had to be white.\" Children's minister Michelle Donelan said: \"I'm extremely concerned... I think we're letting down children.\" The BBC has analysed figures from Ofsted, which has data from 146 of the 153 local authorities that provide fostering services in England. As of 31 March 2019 there were 54,870 children in foster care in England - 76% were white, 23% were BAME. The analysis found 99 authorities - 68% of the 146 - had a shortage or undersupply of foster carers from a BAME background. Authorities were deemed to have an undersupply when the gap between the percentage of carers and percentage of foster children who were BAME was bigger than five, and they had at least 15 children in foster care. Until he turned 18 last year, Shaz, a British Muslim of Pakistani heritage from Bradford, had been in care for four years, spending his time in three different care homes. He was never placed with a Muslim foster family and many of his care staff were white. \"It was weird because, being Muslim, I eat halal meat and I go to the mosque and stuff like that, but then when I transitioned into being in care they didn't know what that meant. \"In quite a lot of circumstances they would give me pork and stuff but then I wouldn't eat it and I would explain to them I wasn't going to eat it but then I would get into arguments and it was like 'you can't force feed me'. \"It felt like there was something wrong with me, something wrong with the colour I was. I felt like I didn't belong and I had to be white. \"In an ideal situation I would have liked to have been fostered by an Asian family because they would be more understanding and open-minded and they would know what to do.\" You may also be interested in: 'Extremely concerned' Ms Donelan, who was appointed as temporary children's minister in September, said: \"I think that's extremely upsetting and I'd love to meet him to hear personally about his own experience and how we can ensure that doesn't happen again in the future. \"I'm extremely concerned about it because I think we're letting down children and that's why we're making sure that we give a focus to adoption and fostering in general as well, because I don't want any child going without a loving home and without that permanence and security that all the research shows gives them the best opportunity in life. \"It's really important to a child that they have some understanding of their roots and their culture and their own identity for their personal development.\" Sagheer Hussain and Fatima Gora, from Bradford, have been fostering children for 16 years and have cared for children from many different backgrounds. Mr Hussain said: \"We live in a multi-cultural society and there's a lot more kids from ethnic backgrounds coming into care. \"We get a lot of phone calls from a lot of carers, white carers, and they'll say 'we've got this child in care, how we meet their needs, what do we need to do for Eid or what do we need to do for their diet?'. \"If there were more carers from BAME backgrounds they'd be able to meet these needs.\" Fostering charity Coram BAAF told the BBC that often when a child came into care the priority was to provide them with a safe place and sometimes their other needs were ignored. Dr John Simmons, director of policy and research at Coram BAAF, said: \"Sometimes something which is so fundamental seems so easily to slip off the agenda, as other more fundamental issues, is there a placement, is there a bed for this child overnight rather than our duty and responsibility to make sure that child actually develops a settled sense of who they are. \"The child's ethnicity and faith are fundamental to who the child will become and to ignore all of that really does put the child at significant risk about developing a secure sense of who they are.\"",

Officers have been investigating the deaths of 17 newborns at the neonatal unit between March 2015 and July 2016. A spokesman said the probe also covered 15 \"non-fatal collapses\". The cases being investigated involve families from the Cheshire and north Wales area. The Countess of Chester declined to comment on whether any staff had been suspended and Cheshire Police would not reveal the role of the healthcare professional within the hospital. Police have confirmed they are searching a property in Westbourne Road, Chester, about a mile from the hospital, in connection with the investigation. Neighbours said a woman lived at the house and had moved in about two years ago. Det Insp Paul Hughes said the investigation was highly complex and very sensitive and officers were doing \"everything we possibly can to try to establish in detail what has led to these baby deaths and collapses\". He said there were \"no set timescales for this coming to a conclusion but we remain committed to carrying out a thorough investigation as soon as possible\". \"Parents of all the babies are continuing to be kept fully updated and are being supported. \"This is an extremely difficult time and it is important to remember that there are bereaved families seeking answers as to what happened to their children.\" Police were asked to investigate the deaths of eight babies in May 2017, a probe which has since widened to include nine more. Analysis: By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England data unit In 2017 the Countess of Chester was among 21 hospitals called upon to investigate higher than average death rates. Authors of the MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries across the UK) report looked at stillbirths and neonatal deaths around the UK in 2015. They found the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust had a neonatal death rate of 1.91 for every 1,000 live births that year. This was the highest out of the 43 trusts of a similar size it was compared with, which had an average of 1.27 neonatal deaths for every 1,000 live births. There were also 5.42 extended perinatal deaths - deaths within four weeks - for every 1,000 births, including stillbirths. The average for similar sized maternity units was 4.73 deaths per 1,000 births. The rate declined in 2016 but was still among the highest in the group. Hospital medical director Ian Harvey said asking police to investigate the deaths had not been \"something we did lightly, but we need to do everything we can to understand what has happened\". He added the neonatal unit was \"safe to continue in its current form\" and remained open to women over 32 weeks in their pregnancy. The unit has 13 cots providing specialist care for about 400 newborn and premature babies born at 32 weeks and above each year. It stopped providing care for those born earlier than 32 weeks in July 2016 after the hospital reported \"a greater number of baby deaths and collapses than normally expected\". A review by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health the following February said no \"definitive explanation\" had been found for the increase in mortality rates at the neonatal unit and there were no \"obvious factors\" linking the deaths. An inspection of the hospital by the Care Quality Commission in 2016 found the unit's nursing staff levels \"did not meet standards recommended by the British Association of Perinatal Medicine\" and it \"lacked storage space and resources\" for effective infection control.",

She said: \"We are in a funding crisis in local government and we are being asked to look at new and innovative ideas.\" Bill Addy CEO of Liverpool Business Improvement District (BID) said although a tourist levy was common in other European cities local businesses would need to be convinced. 'How good Liverpool is' He said: \"Private businesses would say, 'we already pay business rates, we are heavily taxed at 20%, we have a BID, that is a levy on private business'.\" But he said a new levy on hotel rooms would be a way of providing funding for events and training in the hospitality industry. He said: \"The big free activities we've got used to has to come through public sector money, that money is not available, it is about how we replace that money. \"There is also destination marketing - we have to keep telling people about how good Liverpool is\". A similar tax has previously been suggested by cities including Edinburgh, Hull and Bath. Liverpool City Council said it would speak to local businesses about how a potential voluntary levy could work. Analysis: Claire Hamilton, BBC Merseyside political reporter Unusually for Liverpool, there's cross party political consensus for a tourism levy. Most people love the Giants, the fireworks and new pieces of public art. But they all need to be paid for - and with visitor numbers to Liverpool rocketing since it was named the Capital of Culture in 2008, councillors are keen to ensure that more of the cash spent in the region is kept locally. The council wants government to legislate to give it the powers to make the levy compulsory. Without that, a voluntary tax seems hard to sell to businesses who in the past have been extremely sceptical about such a measure.",

The playground was first named after McCreesh in 2001, but the local council voted to retain the name last December. Last year, a report into the 1976 Kingsmills Massacre linked McCreesh to the IRA murders of 10 Protestant men. In a statement on Thursday, the Equality Commission said its investigation would consider whether the council had failed to have due regard to the need to promote equality and good relations between people of different religious beliefs and political opinion. Sectarian killings Unionists on Newry and Mourne District Council objected to the name last year, but Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted to keep it, prompting criticism from relatives of the Kingsmills victims. The victims were all textile workers who were travelling home from their factory in rural south Armagh when IRA gunmen ambushed their minibus and shot 10 of them dead. Last June, a report by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) concluded that the IRA was responsible for the atrocity and that victims were targeted because of their religion. McCreesh was not convicted of the massacre, but the 2012 HET report stated that when he was arrested on another IRA operation, he was caught in possession of one of the guns that had been used in the Kingsmills murders. 'Great offence' Ulster Unionist Danny Kennedy, who had campaigned on behalf of the Kingsmills families, welcomed the Equality Commission's decision to investigate the naming of the playground. He said the vote by Sinn Fein and SDLP councillors in December had \"caused great offence and damaged community relations\". \"I said at the time that I honestly could not think of anyone less deserving of commemoration in any shape or form - let alone a children's play park - than Raymond McCreesh, and that those who voted for this should hang their heads in shame,\" Mr Kennedy added. DUP councillor William Irwin said he had requested the investigation and was pleased that it was going ahead. \"The decision by nationalist councillors to vote in favour of naming a play park after an IRA terrorist was not only grossly offensive to the vast majority of people but cannot meet the council's duty to promote good relations in their area,\" he said. Firearms possession McCreesh, from the village of Camlough, outside Newry, died in the Maze prison in May 1981 at the age of 24. He had been arrested five years earlier during a failed IRA ambush on an Army in south Armagh in 1976.

		"InputText": "By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent The draft area plan for 2017 to 2020 sets out a strategy for changes to the number and nature of schools. Education Minister, Peter Weir, said that a significant number were failing to deliver the best for their pupils. However, no specific proposals for the future of individual schools will be made until early 2017. The draft plan provides a framework for deciding which schools are unsustainable. The document also reveals that almost half of post-primary schools and 40% of primary schools are expected to have budget deficits by 2018-19. The financial position of a school is one of six ways in which it is decided if a school is sustainable or not. The others are quality of educational experience, enrolment trends, strong leadership, accessibility and strong links with the community. Currently, over a third (36%) of primary schools have fewer than 105 pupils, while almost half of post-primary schools have fewer than 500 pupils. Those are the optimal numbers of pupils recommended in the Department of Education's sustainable schools policy. Speaking in the assembly, Mr Weir said: \"We have too many small primary schools with more than two year groups in a single class. \"There are too many schools with too few pupils to generate sufficient funds to deliver the curriculum to an acceptable level. \"It is a real issue particularly in schools with very small sixth forms,\" he added. \"We have schools that are too small to adequately provide for their pupils and ensure they have the opportunity to fulfil their potential. \"The current status quo is not an option.\" Population changes The draft area plan states that the educational needs of pupils must be met \"in the most efficient and effective way possible\". \"This can only be achieved through a network of viable and sustainable schools that are of the right type, the right size, located in the right place and have a focus on raising standards.\" The plan also outlines projected population changes across the 11 council areas in Northern Ireland. For instance, the number of children under 15 years of age in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon council area is set to increase 10% by 2024, the highest increase in Northern Ireland. By contrast, the Ards and North Down council area is projected to have a 2.4% decrease of young people under 15 by 2024. While plans have been published by the EA, they have been drawn up jointly with the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) and other education bodies. They are now out for public consultation until December.",

		"InputText": "A paper detailing its proposals focuses on the need to avoid a hard border. The government stresses there should be no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts, at the border, which has almost 300 crossing points. Critics say the proposals lack credible detail, with Labour deriding the plans for the border as \"a fantasy frontier\". The government's paper does not envisage CCTV cameras or number plate recognition technology at the border, or set back from it. Instead, the government is arguing for a wide-ranging exemption under which small and medium-sized businesses will not have to comply with any new customs tariffs. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that will share a land border with an EU state post-Brexit. The future management of that border is a highly sensitive issue and is one of three main priorities in UK-EU Brexit negotiations. Northern Ireland Office officials say 80% of firms in Northern Ireland are small or medium sized and engaged in local business rather than international trade. If the proposals are accepted, customs officials envisage using a mix of technology and physical checks to monitor the compliance of bigger businesses engaged in international trade. Such firms might be required to declare their import and export businesses online. The government has repeated its desire to maintain the Common Travel Area and the rights of UK and Irish citizens, and to uphold the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, of which the UK is a co-guarantor. Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to reassure nationalists living in Northern Ireland. \"No one voted to end the special ties between the UK and Ireland, or to undermine the unique arrangements between Ireland and Northern Ireland which have underpinned the peace process and have been in place well before our membership of the EU,\" she said. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he broadly agreed with the position paper's \"aspirational\" principles. \"They reflect a lot of the language that the Irish government has been using, actually, in terms of maintaining the status quo, frictionless borders,\" he said. Designed to reassure the European Union Adam Fleming, BBC Brussels Reporter The European Commission responded to the publication of the UK paper by saying there had to be a political deal to protect the Good Friday Agreement before a discussion could begin on technical measures. The paper is full of language and examples designed to soothe the EU about its worries. Michel Barnier said the Good Friday Agreement must be guaranteed. The UK said it would be. The Common Travel Area, which allows free movement between the UK and Ireland, is enshrined in an EU Treaty and letting it continue wouldn't be illegal under European Law. One British official said privately that if no agreement is reached, EU rules would compel the Irish government to introduce the hard border it does not want. Labour's spokesman on Northern Ireland, Stephen Pound, said an ID card system would have to be introduced to manage immigration after Brexit. \"The idea of having a CGI, virtual reality border is nonsense, it's just a pipe dream but the second thing is it's about goods, it's not about people,\" he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he had discussed the issue at length with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier during a meeting in Brussels, in which he said there must be no hard border. \"I hope there can now be negotiations to make sure there is a continuation of absolute free movement between the Republic and Northern Ireland,\" he said. Critics argue the re-introduction of the hard border would severely damage the Northern Ireland peace process and have a negative economic impact. A European Commission spokeswoman said: \"We must discuss how to maintain the Common Travel Area and protect, in all of its dimensions, the Good Friday Agreement. \"It is essential that we have a political discussion on this before looking at technical solutions.\" Sea border dismissed The position paper forms part of the government's negotiations with the European Union, ahead of the UK leaving the EU in March 2019. As revealed on Tuesday, Brexit Secretary David Davis wants a limited transition period to implement any new customs arrangements, including considerations relating to the \"unique circumstances\" of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Both the UK and Irish governments have repeatedly stated their opposition to a hard border, but the situation is complicated as the UK intends to leave the EU's customs union. The position paper sets out two \"broad approaches\" to future customs arrangements that the UK hopes will help to prevent physical customs posts along the Irish border. The suggestions are a \"new customs partnership\" or a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\". The partnership model would \"align\" customs approaches between the UK and the EU, resulting in \"no customs border at all between the UK and Ireland,\" the paper claims. The paper suggests the second, \"highly-streamlined\" arrangement could include: The paper also dismisses the idea of a customs border in the Irish Sea, saying it would be economically and constitutionally unviable. It recognises that all this needs to be negotiated with the EU, in the hope that the border between the EU and the UK will be as \"seamless\" as possible. Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said he did not accept that the EU would be unwilling to facilitate the government's proposals. \"If you look at what [EU chief negotiator] Michel Barnier has said... there is a recognition that there will need to be specific arrangements in relation to customs and other elements in terms of creating that frictionless border,\" he said. \"There is a shared objective that we have, that the EU has and the Irish government has, in finding that solution.\" UK-Irish trade in numbers The Ulster Unionist Party welcomed the government's position paper, while Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster said it was a \"constructive step\". \"It is clear the government has listened to voices in Belfast, Dublin, Brussels and London about how the United Kingdom's only EU land border could be managed after we exit the EU,\" said Mrs Foster, NI's former first minister. However, Sinn Féin northern leader Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland was \"a fleeting concern for the British government, we are collateral damage\". \"What we need to see is the Irish government acting in the national interest and defending the rights of those people here in the north that voted to stay with the European Union,\" she said. Colum Eastwood, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), said the government seemed to be \"effectively playing for more time\". What is the customs union? Countries in the customs union do not impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods. Every country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad. So, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee. Other goods - such as soap or slate - have no tariffs. The UK has said it is leaving the EU's customs union because as a member it is unable to strike trade deals with other countries.",

The NI Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which created the Irish Sea border. It is opposed by Northern Ireland's unionist parties who have said it undermines their place in the UK. Under the terms of the Brexit withdrawal treaty, the Protocol can only be removed by a majority vote of the Stormont Assembly, with a vote due in 2024. Responding to questions in the House of Lords, Lord Frost said the protocol needs to be implemented in a \"proportionate manner\". \"We are working with the European Union to that effect,\" he added. Unilateral changes Earlier this month, the UK government changed how the protocol is being implemented without EU agreement. It delayed the introduction of new sea border checks on food, parcels and pets. It also moved unilaterally to ease the trade in horticultural products across from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The EU has begun legal action as a consequence. The European Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the UK saying these actions breach the substantive provisions of the protocol as well as the good faith obligation under the Withdrawal Agreement. It has asked the UK to respond by the middle of April before it decides on further legal steps. Lord Frost also revealed the Northern Ireland Specialised Committee will meet on Friday. It is an official-level technical group which prepares for political discussions between the EU and UK. Meanwhile, a coalition of unionists challenging the Northern Ireland Protocol say they expect a full high court hearing in May.

		"InputText": "By Brian WheelerPolitical reporter, BBC News In a speech to his party's spring conference, the PM declared war on the \"enemies of enterprise\" - and said he was on the side of \"go-getters\". And he vowed 23 March's Budget would be the \"most pro-growth this country has seen for a generation\". But Labour accused Mr Cameron of \"warm words but no action\". Chancellor George Osborne has already told the Tory conference in Cardiff that his Budget will be \"unashamedly pro-growth\" and will include 10 new enterprise zones to boost some of the most deprived areas of England. 'Spark of initiative' Mr Cameron used his speech to reinforce his pro-growth message, and to promise a \"fundamental rebalancing of our economy\" with \"less debt, more saving; less borrowing, more investment; less dependence on financial services, more new industries, exports and trade\". With interest rates at a record low, and no money to spare, the prime minister said he wanted to champion the growth and ingenuity of the British people. He said: \"The spark of initiative. The courage to make your dream happen. The hard work to see it through. \"There's only one strategy for growth we can have now and that is rolling up our sleeves and doing everything possible to make it easier for businesses to grow, to invest, to take people on. \"Back small firms. Boost enterprise. Be on the side of everyone in this country who wants to create jobs, and wealth and opportunity.\" 'Social good' On a practical level, Mr Cameron promised to open up government procurement processes to more small businesses. \"I can announce today that we are taking on the enemies of enterprise. \"The bureaucrats in government departments who concoct those ridiculous rules and regulations that make life impossible for small firms. \"The town hall officials who take forever to make those planning decisions that can be make or break for a business - and the investment and jobs that go with it. \"The public sector procurement managers who think that the answer to everything is a big contract with a big business and who shut out millions of Britain's small and medium sized companies from a massive potential market.\" 'Reckless plan' Mr Cameron said \"enterprise is not just about markets - it's about morals too\", adding: \"We understand that enterprise is not just an economic good, it's a social good.\" And he said the Conservatives had always been a \"party of builders and businesswomen; electricians and engineers; roofers and retailers\". \"At its beating heart this is still a party of start-ups, go-getters, risk-takers. \"What drives us is getting things done - and what drives us mad is the bureaucracy, the forms, the nonsense getting in our way.\" It was speech that focused almost exclusively on domestic issues, but he did touch on Libya and repeated his call for Colonel Gaddafi to \"go\". He also urged Conservative activists to vote against changing the voting system in the referendum on 5 May. 'Reheated rhetoric' Labour has accused the Conservatives of lacking a strategy for growth and being more interested in grabbing headlines. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: \"When we urgently need a plan for jobs and growth to get the economy moving again and help hard-pressed families all David Cameron and George Osborne can offer is empty words but precious little action. \"All we've heard from this conference is the reheated rhetoric and warmed up policies of 30 years ago - a VAT rise, deep spending cuts, knee-jerk deregulation and enterprise zones which didn't work when they were tried in the 1980s. \"If David Cameron wants to know who is the real enemy of enterprise and growth in Britain today he only needs to look next door at his own chancellor. \"It is George Osborne's reckless plan to cut too deep and too fast, which has seen the economy go into reverse. \"",

But 4.4 million pensioners will be worse off next year when age-related tax allowances are frozen and axed. Mr Osborne said the Budget \"rewards work\" but Labour Leader Ed Miliband labelled it a \"millionaire's Budget\". BBC political editorNick Robinson said the chancellorhad taken a huge gamble with changes that might not shape the economy, but would shape politics in the months ahead. Other key measures outlined by Mr Osborne were: Delivering his third Budget, he said: \"This Budget supports working families and helps those looking for work. \"It unashamedly backs business. And it is on the side of aspiration: those who want to do better for themselves and for their families.\" He defended the decision to cut the top rate of tax by saying five times as much would be raised from the wealthiest by other tax and anti-avoidance measures being brought in. He said the rate was the highest among G20 countries and damaged competitiveness. A report into the highest rate, introduced by Labour in 2010, had found it had raised just a third of the £3bn initially predicted, Mr Osborne said. \"No chancellor can justify a tax rate that damages our economy and raises next to nothing.\" 'Granny tax' He said a further £1,100 rise in the threshold at which income tax is paid from next year would benefit \"every working person on low or middle incomes\" and amounted to an extra £220 a year each - or £170 after inflation. Tax allowances are currently more generous for the over-65s - at £10,500 up to age 74 and £10,660 after that. But they will be frozen, and stopped for anyone turning 65 after 5 April 2013, meaning 4.41 million people will be worse off, by an average of £83, in real terms in 2013-14. Mr Osborne said it would simplify allowances and no pensioner would lose out \"in cash terms\". He pointed to next month's \"biggest cash increase in the state pension ever\" of £5.30 a week. But the unions said pensioners were \"paying the price for a pro-rich Budget\". TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said the chancellor's decision would \"come back to haunt him\" and was \"already being dubbed 'the granny tax'\". HM Revenue and Customs figures also show that 300,000 people will be drawn into paying the 40% higher rate tax from 2013-14 because of a reduction in the threshold to £41,450. A new 7% rate of stamp duty would be charged on properties worth more than £2m - and anyone trying to buy a £2m home through a company would face a punitive 15% stamp duty rate. Child benefit had been due to be removed from all families with at least one parent paying the higher, 40% rate, of income tax - about £43,000 - from January 2013. But Mr Osborne said he wanted to avoid a \"cliff edge\" effect - so it would now only be withdrawn when someone in a household earned more than £50,000, at a rate of 1% of the benefit for every £100 up until £60,000, when it would be cut entirely. It meant 750,000 more households would not now lose all their child benefit. Corporation tax He said corporation tax would be cut more than expected from next month, to 24% rather than 25% as planned, falling to 22% by 2014, something he said would be \"an advertisement for investment and jobs in Britain\". Mr Osborne also announced there would be limits on uncapped tax reliefs. In his last big financial update - the Autumn Statement in November - the chancellor lowered growth forecasts for the UK economy and extended the period of spending cuts by a year to 2016-17. But he was able to nudge up the growth forecast for 2012 - which had been revised down from 2.5% to 0.7% - to 0.8% and said he was \"on course\" to eliminate the structural deficit by 2016-7. He also said the Independent Office for Budget Responsibility expected the UK would avoid a \"technical recession\" - but that the eurozone crisis and a spike in oil prices continued to pose risks. Labour Leader Ed Miliband labelled it a \"millionaire's budget\". \"Tax credits cut, child benefit taken away, fuel duty rising - and what has he chosen to make his priorities? \"For Britain's millionaires, a massive income tax cut each and every year.\" Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg described it as a Budget \"every liberal can be proud of\".

On Tuesday, Channel 4 News accused the officer of falsely claiming to have seen the events in an email to his MP. The Metropolitan Police Federation later strongly denied any \"conspiracy\". Channel 4 News alleged the police officer posed as a member of the public who witnessed the row in which Mr Mitchell was said to have called police \"plebs\". Mr Mitchell has always denied using the word but has admitted he had lost his temper and swore at the officers after they refused to let him cycle through the main gate to Downing Street. A spokesman for No 10 said of the latest claims: \"Any allegations that a serving police officer posed as a member of the public and fabricated evidence against a cabinet minister are exceptionally serious. \"It is therefore essential that the police get to the bottom of this as a matter of urgency.\" He added: \"We welcome [Metropolitan Police commissioner] Bernard Hogan-Howe's commitment to achieve that aim.\" John Tully, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents officers in the Met Police, said: \"The Metropolitan Police Federation unequivocally and categorically refutes any allegation that it was part of a conspiracy to unseat a cabinet minister.\" 'Utmost gravity' A Diplomatic Protection Squad officer was arrested on Saturday by officers investigating how national newspapers came to publish police records of the incident. Although the arrested officer was not on duty at the time, they claimed to have witnessed the incident - a claim now being probed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The Conservative MP told Channel 4 News he had been \"really shocked\" to learn of its allegations that the original newspaper coverage of the claim he had used the word \"pleb\" had been corroborated by the email from the officer pretending to be an eyewitness. \"I always knew that the emails were false, although extremely convincing,\" Mr Mitchell, MP for Sutton Coldfield, said. \"If you'd told me on 19 September [the night of the row] that the experience I have had since then, the revelations that have since come to light, could take place in Britain today, I simply would not have believed you. \"And it's certainly shaken my lifelong support and confidence in the police. \"I believe now that there should be a full inquiry so that we can get to the bottom of this, so that everyone can have confidence that this sort of thing won't happen again.\" London Mayor Boris Johnson said: \"An allegation that a serving police officer posed as a member of the public whilst fabricating evidence is a matter of the utmost gravity. \"I know that the Metropolitan Police Commissioner is committed to establishing the truth here, as soon as possible.\" BBC political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Johnson's comments were the first time there had been suggestion of a conspiracy involving police officers. Channel 4 News broadcast CCTV footage which it said cast doubt on the official police log of the night of the row. The footage shows the MP with his bicycle talking to three officers by the main gate at Downing Street for about 20 seconds. He then wheels it over to the side gate and exits. Mr Mitchell said on Channel 4 News that his first reaction was \"there's not really much of an altercation\" when the story about his dealings with the police emerged. \"There were three phrases above all which were hung around my neck for the following 28 days every day in the press which were used to destroy my political career and were used to toxify the Conservative Party,\" he added. Before the footage was broadcast, Mr Hogan-Howe had told the BBC that he had seen no reason to doubt the original claims by the Downing Street police officers. MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said he planned to write to the Met commissioner to ask for a full explanation of what happened. 'Real injustice' Mr Mitchell told Channel 4 News he would never call anyone the name which he was accused of using, adding, \"anyone who know me well would know that it is absolutely not in me to use phrases like that\". Asked why he did not give a more detailed account earlier, Mr Mitchell said: \"Well, when the story broke, the decision was made that I would apologise for what I did say, and my apology was accepted; there was no police complaints and that we would let it lie. \"Now with the benefit of hindsight, that was clearly the wrong decision.\" Following the airing of the Channel 4 News report, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt tweeted: \"Incredibly concerned at v serious C4 Dispatches suggestion that A Mitchell was stitched up, never believed he used p-word anyway.\" Conservative MP David Davis told the BBC: \"He has suffered a real injustice. His reputation has been traduced, he's lost his job, his career's come to an end and to all intents and purposes that's pretty tough on the basis of something that may not now be quite the way it looked at the beginning.\"",

He had been \"horrified\", she said in an email submitted as evidence to the court that found her guilty of perverting the course of justice. But Mr Cable said he had \"no recollection\" of the incident. Huhne and Pryce have both been convicted of perverting the course of justice, 10 years after Huhne's BMW car was caught by a speed camera on the M11 motorway between Stansted Airport, in Essex, and London. Pryce, a prominent economist, had falsely informed police she had been the driver of the car, so Huhne would avoid prosecution. He was in danger of losing his licence having already accrued nine penalty points. She argued in court that he had forced her to take the points, but her defence of marital coercion failed. 'Nail him' During her trial, the court saw a series of emails between Vicky Pryce and Sunday Times journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who broke news of the scandal. In one message dated 9 April 2011, Pryce told Ms Oakeshott: \"I had told Vince and [his wife] Rachel about points before when the three of us were having supper about a month ago - they were horrified at the time but VC has probably forgotten it by now.

In an email on 1 March 2011, Ms Oakeshott said: \"We could perhaps go away somewhere nice for a few days, to work on it [the story] in complete privacy and in relaxed surroundings. \"It wouldn't have to be anywhere fancy (though it could be!) and I'm sure the Sunday Times would help foot the bill.

The deputy prime minister said Sir John would like to finish his work \"as soon as possible\". The Cabinet Office said discussions over documents should end \"shortly\".

But if a picture ever prompted a thousand words, it was this one. Early rumblings The hash-tags sprung up instantly. Islington, Ms Thornberry's parliamentary seat, became less a borough than an abstraction, furthering a perception, according to Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP for Rochdale, that the Labour Party \"has been hijacked by the north London liberal elite\". The S-word - 15:13 @GuidoFawkes (137,000 followers) ensures @EmilyThornberry (14,400 followers) gets a bigger platform for her views. Tories lick their lips Communities Secretary Eric Pickles was first in with the knife, saying: \"We should have pride in flying the Cross of St George - don't knock the national flag of England.\" Prime Minister David Cameron also appreciated the free hit, saying the Labour MP's actions were \"completely appalling\" and suggesting that she was \"sneering at people who work hard, are patriotic and love their country\". Backpedalling - 18:15 Emily Thornberry told Mail Online: \"It was a house covered in British flags. I've never seen anything like it before.\" \"It had three huge flags covering the whole house. I thought it was remarkable. I've never seen a house completely covered in flags.\" On Friday, Peter Spence of the Daily Telegraph helped her out - perhaps - by highlighting a previous picture she tweeted in 2012. 'Nightmare splash' The BBC's Ross Hawkins noted that the Sun's front page was a \"nightmare\" for Labour, and posed three questions. Damage done - resignation announced 22:30 Shortly after the polls closed in Rochester it was reported that Ms Thornberry had resigned from the shadow cabinet. Throughout Thursday she spoke twice to Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was said to be \"furious\" that the tweet had tripped Labour up on a day when the Tories' loss to UKIP was supposed to dominate the news cycle. Mr Miliband agreed it was best that Ms Thornberry resign. Backlash to the backlash Was Emily Thornberry hard done by? Labour MPs from John Mann to Douglas Alexander seem to think not, having lined up to denounce the tweet and say it was right for Ms Thornberry to resign. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey was asked on Friday if the events surrounding Emily Thornberry's tweets made him frightened at the power of the medium he created. He answered: \"I don't think it's any different from what we've been doing as a humanity - it's just faster.\"",

But she said: \"I'll be fighting for what I believe in until the very end.\" Ex-minister Alan Milburn followed Tony Blair in warning against a victory for Mr Corbyn - while ex-deputy PM Lord Prescott told the party to \"calm down\". Mr Milburn told the BBC the party would only win the next election if it occupied the centre ground. He added: \"The alternative is that Labour lurches to the left. If it does that, frankly, it has a death wish.\" 'Don't leave it to the boys' Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor, said pressure had been mounting on Ms Kendall to withdraw from the race. But the Leicester West MP rejected that idea in a BBC interview - after her aides had accused Andy Burnham's and Yvette Cooper's camps of \"fuelling\" the idea. One source said: \"Both Andy and Yvette have seen their numbers fall this week following the flip flop over welfare and that's what is making these campaigns try and make Liz somehow the problem to distract from their own issues.\" The source said that under the preference voting system it would not make any difference, even if Ms Kendall pulled out. Ms Kendall said she had always been an outsider in the race but said there were 51 days left to get people's support. She said a victory for Mr Corbyn would be a \"disaster\", saying that turning back to the politics of the 1980s and losing elections \"does nothing to help the people\" the party wants to help. Ms Kendall added that she was the only candidate offering an alternative to the politics which lost the party the last two elections, saying her policies would help Labour win power \"so we can change the country for the better\". Labour leadership contest At-a-glance profiles of the four contenders Earlier, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Cooper said Ms Kendall should \"certainly not\" withdraw from the contest and \"leave it to the boys, just because of one poll\". The Labour leadership race has been the subject of widespread debate after a YouGov poll this week suggested that in the final round of voting Mr Corbyn could finish six points ahead of bookmakers' favourite Mr Burnham. The poll suggested Mr Corbyn could receive 43% of first preference votes, ahead of Mr Burnham on 26%, Ms Cooper on 20% and Ms Kendall on 11%. Taking second preferences into account, the poll - of 1,054 people eligible to vote in the contest and carried out between Friday and Tuesday - pointed to a 6% victory for Mr Corbyn. Labour MP Frank Field, one of the MPs who \"lent\" Mr Corbyn his nomination, said the debate \"hasn't been widened\" by his candidacy, and the other candidates needed to up their game to defeat him. \"I hope that in this whole process at least one of the candidates who say they oppose Jeremy has actually got both the physical courage and the intellectual clout to start that debate. \"If not goodness knows what position we will be in after the votes are counted,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. 'A terrible legacy' Speaking to the Times, Lord Mandelson warned the Labour Party's existence as \"an electoral force\" was at stake. \"Those of us who stayed and fought to save the Labour Party in the 1980s will be experiencing a growing sense of deja vu,\" he told the Times. \"The last five years have left us with a terrible legacy to overcome with the existence of the Labour Party as an effective electoral force now at stake.\" On Tuesday, former prime minister Mr Blair warned Labour would not win again from a \"traditional leftist platform\". And former adviser to Mr Blair, John McTernan, told BBC Newsnight two of the candidates should withdraw in favour of an \"anyone but Corbyn\" candidate. Former deputy leader Lord Prescott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Blair had been wrong to \"abuse\" supporters of Mr Corbyn with his \"transplant\" comment. He also said acting leader Harriet Harman had overstepped her authority in setting out Labour's support for some of the government's welfare cuts. Lord Prescott, Mr Blair's deputy PM for ten years, added: \"Who the hell is John McTernan?\" He said it would not be a disaster if Jeremy Corbyn won, but said he would not be voting for him, adding: \"It's the party's decision not the MPs'.\" Labour is due to announce its new leader at a special conference on 12 September.",

		"InputText": "The new regulations - which permit drilling from outside the protected areas - were approved by 298 to 261. Opposition parties and campaigners criticised the lack of a Commons debate - and accused ministers of a U-turn as they previously pledged an outright ban on fracking in national parks. The government said its plans would protect \"our most precious landscapes\". Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom also said there had already been \"enormous debate\" on the subject. Ballot papers MPs overwhelmingly rejected a bid to suspend drilling for shale gas in a Commons vote in January, during which ministers also pledged an \"outright ban\" on fracking in national parks. Labour has said the government's plans, contained in a draft regulation, represent a U-turn on this commitment, and called for stronger safeguards. The proposals, first set out in July, would only allow fracking 1,200m below national parks, Areas of Outstanding National Beauty, the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads and World Heritage Sites. The drill rigs would have to be positioned outside the boundaries of the protected areas. Q&A: What is fracking? Sites of Special Scientific Interest, which are designated to protect wildlife or geology, are not mentioned. MPs opposed the passing of the draft regulation when it was read out in the Commons on Tuesday evening. Because this happened after the conclusion of the day's main business, parliamentary rules required the vote to be deferred - until Wednesday. Under this process of so-called deferred divisions, MP voted on the proposal by filling in ballot papers with the result announced later by Deputy Speaker Natascha Engel. Shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy accused ministers of using a \"parliamentary backdoor\" to try to approve the \"weak regulations\" without debate. She said: \"Fracking should not go ahead in Britain until stronger safeguards are in place to protect drinking water sources and sensitive parts of our countryside like national parks.\" The political battle over fracking The vote to allow fracking under national parks is the latest stage of the political battle over drilling for shale gas, writes BBC political reporter Tom Moseley. MPs voted in January to continue with fracking, and David Cameron declared last year the UK was going \"all out\" for shale gas - but it remains a controversial issue in the Commons. This is particularly true for MPs - including many Conservatives - facing fracking, and vocal anti-fracking campaigns, in their constituencies. In January the government said there would be an outright ban on fracking in protected areas. But that was under the Tory/Lib Dem coalition, and in July the new Conservative administration unveiled new guidelines allowing drilling at least 1,200m under ground. These were the regulations approved in today's deferred division - sparking accusations of a U-turn from Labour, which wants a moratorium on fracking until \"we can be sure it is safe\". Four Tories voted against the government including London mayoral candidate and environmental campaigner Zac Goldsmith and Sarah Wollaston, whose Totnes seat includes Dartmoor national park. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the government had shown a \"complete lack of regard for protecting some of the most beautiful scenery in the UK and its wildlife\", while Greenpeace criticised the use of what it called an \"arcane parliamentary process\". Rose Dickinson, of Friends of the Earth, said the new rules would put drinking water and national parks \"at risk of fracking\" and represented \"a complete U-turn on earlier promises\". No fracking is currently taking place in the UK, but details of sites where drilling is likely to take place are expected on Wednesday. More than 100 sites, of 10km across, are expected to be granted licences, with most in Northern England. Ms Leadsom said it was \"rubbish\" to say the government had tried to \"sneak in\" the new regulations. Responding to criticism from environmental campaigners, she said moving from coal to gas was a \"huge decarbonisation win\", adding that shale gas could improve energy security, as well as creating \"thousands of jobs\" and \"billions to the exchequer\". A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman added: \"The UK has one of the best track records in the world for protecting our environment while developing our industries - these regulations will get this vital industry moving while protecting our environment and people.\"",

Until now, MPs who wanted to install security had to apply through the parliamentary expenses watchdog Ipsa. But the BBC's Norman Smith said MPs had decided to strip the watchdog of its authority over security decisions amid concerns over delays to MPs' requests. Following a decision by the Estimates Committee of MPs on Tuesday, all MPs will automatically be offered extra security - such as panic buttons, extra lighting, additional locks and emergency fobs - and will not have to apply to have them installed. Previously, MPs wanting enhanced security arrangements had to have to a risk assessment carried out by the police and written estimates before any work could be carried out. Jo Cox died last month after being attacked in her West Yorkshire constituency, the first MP to be killed for more than 25 years. The safety of MPs outside the Houses of Parliament is the responsibility of local police forces but Ipsa has responsibility for approving funding for security procedures and dealing with requests from individual MPs. 'Providing assurance' The watchdog's chairman wrote to MPs in the aftermath of Ms Cox's death to say the way in which it handled applications would be \"reviewed and accelerated\" in response to concerns about its role. In January, the security measures available to MPs at their constituency offices and homes were \"standardised\" - to try to speed up the process and ensure all 650 members of the Commons receive a consistent service. They were divided into two packages: routine and enhanced claims. The former is based on MPs filling in self-assessment forms although MPs must obtain two separate quotes from locksmiths. Those seeking additional protection in response to a specific threat must consult local police commanders who are expected to make recommendations based on a security and intelligence review. In 2014-15, £77,000 was spent on additional security measures designed to enable MPs to fulfil their duties following police recommendations. The Estimates Committee, responsible for financial and logistical support to MPs that has not been outsourced to Ipsa, is chaired by Commons Speaker John Bercow and its members include the Leader of the House of Commons and representatives from the main parties. A spokesperson for the House of Commons Commission, which supervises the overall running of the Houses of Parliament, said it did not publicly discuss the details of security arrangements and \"in the event that arrangements to MPs security are revised further, this information will be communicated privately to them\". An Ipsa spokesperson said: \"We have been working in partnership with the police and the House of Commons since last year to improve the security support available to MPs and their staff. We have recently streamlined the way we provide this support, responding to the security needs of MPs as defined by the police, while continuing to provide assurance about the public money spent.\"",

The Metropolitan Police told the BBC it \"spoke to all occupants of the address, who were all safe and well\". In a statement, it said \"there was no cause for police action\". A spokesman for Mr Johnson said: \"No comment\". Mr Johnson refused to answer questions as he arrived at Birmingham ahead of the first of the Conservative Party's leadership membership hustings. Earlier, a neighbour of Ms Symonds in Camberwell, south London, told the Guardian they had heard a woman screaming followed by \"slamming and banging\". The paper said the neighbour was inside their own flat when they recorded the alleged altercation. 'No offences or concerns' It said that in the recording - heard by the newspaper, but not by the BBC - Mr Johnson was refusing to leave the flat and told the woman to \"get off\" his laptop, before there was a loud crashing noise. Ms Symonds is allegedly heard saying the MP had ruined a sofa with red wine: \"You just don't care for anything because you're spoilt. You have no care for money or anything.\" Another neighbour, who would only give her name as Fatima, told the BBC: \"I heard a female voice, shouting and screaming, and then I heard things smashing, it sounded like plates or glasses. \"I couldn't hear what she was saying but she sounded really angry.\" Conservative MP Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he could not comment on the Guardian's report specifically but said character was relevant in the contest to be leader of the party. \"They are going to be in a position of responsibility where they have to make very important decisions,\" he said. The former attorney general added: \"Clearly, things like reliability and honesty are very important things. \"And I think they matter in one's private and personal life, and also they matter in one's public life.\" Analysis By BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson Boris Johnson would have preferred his politics - not his private life - to be making headlines. As we enter the final stage of this leadership campaign the scrutiny of the two men who want the top job will no doubt increase. There will be intense focus on their every move; their past, their present and their future. It's not surprising given the importance of the job they want - running the country. But does what allegedly happened in the London flat Mr Johnson shares with his partner really matter? His critics will say yes. They argue that we need someone of good character who can make difficult decisions and work under pressure. Supporters of Boris Johnson disagree. Whatever happened, they say, was an entirely private matter between two people in a relationship which should never have been recorded by a neighbour. Journalist Sonia Purnell, who has written a biography of Mr Johnson, told the Today programme she believed it was important to know a future leader's character. She said: \"It is the most unbelievably pressured job, crises will be coming at you day and night. You have to have equilibrium, a clear head, a stability in your life to be able to cope with that.\" 'Would be toast' But, political commentator Tim Montgomerie told the BBC that until a complaint was made by Ms Symonds, the row \"should be a non-issue\". He added: \"If there was any domestic violence, Boris Johnson's candidacy would be toast and would deserve to be. \"But all we have at the moment is a partially overheard conversation between two people late at night. \"Unless there is a complaint I think we should draw a line under this.\" Some of Mr Johnson's supporters have also taken to social media to defend him. Brexit minister James Cleverly questioned the motives of the \"person who recorded Boris and then gave the story to the Guardian\". Tory MP Michael Fabricant appeared to confuse Camberwell with Islington but wrote he was glad he did not have \"nosey neighbours\" recording private conversations, sending them to newspapers and \"wasting police time for political advantage\". Bookmakers' favourite Mr Johnson's relationship with Ms Symonds - a former director of communications for the Conservative party - became public after Mr Johnson and his wife announced they were divorcing in 2018. Ms Symonds was seen in the audience during Mr Johnson's leadership campaign launch on 12 June. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said: \"At 00:24 on Friday 21 June, police responded to a call from a local resident in the SE5 area of Camberwell. \"The caller was concerned for the welfare of a female neighbour. \"Police attended and spoke to all occupants of the address, who were all safe and well. There were no offences or concerns apparent to the officers and there was no cause for police action.\" Mr Johnson is the bookmakers' favourite to succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader and the UK's next prime minister. The former foreign secretary and Mayor of London is in a run-off with Jeremy Hunt, with Tory party members due to vote over the next month. Mr Johnson came top in a ballot of Tory MPs on Thursday.

Unemployment amongst 16 to 19-year-olds is already at its lowest level for several years. The government has a promise of a place in education or training to everyone in that age group who does not have a job. The number of so-called teenage Neets - youngsters who aren't in education, employment or training - has been declining. Good jobs Often there are very specific, and challenging, reasons to explain the situation of unemployed teenagers. But some concerns remain. Colleges will always point to examples of achievement: young people whose studies lead them to a good job or towards a university qualification. However, the question is the extent to which this guarantee of a place in education may sometimes simply \"park\" the youth unemployment problem until people are in their early 20s. In other words, are some young people found places on courses they don't especially want to be doing because they would otherwise be out of work? If so, these reluctant learners might be more likely to find themselves unemployed - or at least underused - once they are out of education (the same, of course, can be equally true of a middle class youngster who has only gone to university because of parental pressure). Vocational education There are all kinds of challenges and potential solutions here. One is helping ensure young people get the best possible careers guidance and vocational education. That way youngsters are more likely to be doing courses they want to do and benefit from them. Another is to help increase the number of modern apprenticeships available - often they provide a good alternative to university or a full-time college course. But another challenge concerns unemployment itself. Ultimately, employers need to be willing to recruit and jobs need to be available. Reducing youth unemployment substantially may well be just as much about economic policy as education. But the greater the young person's skills, the less likely they are to become an unemployment statistic.",

		"InputText": "By Marc EllisonData journalist, BBC Scotland The Scottish government set out a \"test and protect\" strategy in May 2020 which was designed to minimise the spread of coronavirus. So, how does it work? When an individual receives a positive result, a team of contact tracers are tasked with finding out where they had been and who they had been around. What is gathered helps build a picture about the virus, but crucially, this is not a scientific exercise so it it does not answer the question about where that person contracted Covid-19. Since 1 November, Public Health Scotland (PHS) has published \"events and settings\" data for people who have tested positive. The most up-to-date information shows shops account for 20% of the places visited by people the week before their test. Nearly 1,500 trips to supermarkets and shopping centres were recorded in the first week of December. And the proportion of shop-related visits has steadily increased despite 11 councils having been in the toughest level for the past three weeks. Within the data set, locations are broken down into the main categories of events and activities, accommodation, transport, work, and education. These are then sub-categorised and include things like eating out, shopping, personal care and food production. The data is not broken down by council or health board, making it hard to establish what impact level four restrictions have had over the last few weeks. However, the figures appear to show several national trends since 1 November, including increasingly fewer trips for personal care - such as nail salons and hairdressers. The data for the most recent week shows: While the number of people testing positive each week is decreasing, the contact tracing data appears to show a shift in behaviour as the Christmas season approaches. Colin Wilkinson, the managing director of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association (SLTA), said shops were a risk area. He said retail, unlike pubs and restaurants, were not mandated to have a \"test and protect\" service. 'We believe shopping is as safe as possible' Mr Wilkinson added: \"And if you go into a shop there's a lot more 'touch points'. You don't wipe down every can, every packet, every item of clothing. \"Now that many areas are moving down to tier three and shops can re-open, you can just see there's going to be a mass influx of people going shopping.\" However, a spokesman for the Scottish Retail Consortium said it would be \"misleading and irresponsible\" to suggest that the transmission of coronavirus was more likely in a retail setting. He added: \"Retailers in Scotland have spent tens of millions of pounds to ensure the safety of colleagues and customers, which includes Perspex screens, hand cleaning facilities, social distancing, and they continue to ensure customers follow government guidance on face coverings and physical distancing. \"As long as customers continue to follow Scottish government and retailer guidance we continue to believe shopping is as safe as possible in these current challenging circumstances.\" Dr Antonia Ho, a consultant in infectious disease and viral epidemiologist at the University of Glasgow, stressed that the total number of traced settings had decreased significantly from 15,318 to 7,302. She added that, unlike bars, people do not tend to spend prolonged periods of time or have close contact with others in shops. Dr Ho explained: \"The risk of getting in these settings will more likely relate to touching contaminated items such as shopping trollies and surfaces. \"We know that fomite transmission [like touching contaminated surfaces] do contribute to transmission, but we don't have a good idea of the relative contribution compared to droplet transmission.\" She added that it was not surprising shopping and households now have higher relative contributions as these were the only settings most of the Scottish population had been able to access under level four rules. At First Minister's Questions on Thursday, Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged that with the lifting of restrictions and the Christmas holidays approaching more people would be going shopping. She told MSPs that the government had had \"recent contact\" with nine \"major supermarkets\" to check that they were ensuring the continued safety of shoppers and staff. Ms Sturgeon added: \"As Christmas approaches I think we all expect that stores will be busier at times and it is therefore all the more important over the next few weeks that the safety of both staff and customers is prioritised. \"I would appeal to all retailers, particularly as level four ends across 11 local authorities for retailers at six tomorrow morning, to be really responsible.\" Scotland's National Clinical Director Jason Leitch said he would not like to see the crowded scenes from London's Regent Street last weekend. He added: \"It filled me with absolute dread for London's numbers and their numbers today are up, it's as simple as that,\" Public Health Scotland also publishes data documenting contact tracing by health board. The weekly figures show a regional breakdown of individuals with a positive Covid-19 test, and the number of unique contacts traced through the \"test and protect\" system. In the first week of December, the average number of people traced to a single positive case in Dumfries and Galloway was three times the number in Greater Glasgow. This could be attributed to the fact that the former was in a lower level with fewer restrictions on movement.",

They hope to launch the new Funeral Expense Assistance benefit by the summer of 2019. Equalities Secretary Angela Constance said she was taking \"decisive action\" over what was a \"growing issue\". The cost of burials and cremations has been on the rise, studies have shown. In 2016 a basic burial, on average, cost more than £1,300, excluding undertakers fees, while the average local authority cremation cost £670. A 2016 study by the Stirling Citizens Advice bureau found there had been a steep rise in so-called \"paupers' funerals\", which cost local authorities £500,000 in the previous year. The new benefit is part of a 10-point plan which commits the government to a range of actions over funeral costs. It includes a range of advice services, including guidance on funeral costs, consumer protection in relation to funeral plans, a Social Innovation Fund to tackle funeral poverty and the pilot of a \"funeral bond\" to help people save up for their own burial.

A statement from the SPA said Mr Foley would be paid in lieu of his contractual notice as well as an early retirement payment. Earlier this year, Scotland's police watchdog had criticised \"dysfunctional\" relationships at the top of the SPA. A review by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland described a \"fundamental weakness\" at the board. Mr Foley's departure follows the announcement two months ago that SPA chairman Andrew Flanagan was to resign. The SPA statement said the role of chief executive has become redundant because of a change which will see the director of forensic services reporting directly to the authority's board. Future strategy Commenting on the decision that Mr Foley should leave, Mr Flanagan said: \"\"This new reporting arrangement is a further tangible step in strengthening oversight of forensic services, and will support work to develop a long-term strategy for forensics to complement the 2026 strategy for Police Scotland. \"I want to pay tribute to the professionalism which he has shown throughout our consideration of this, and indeed for the valued service he has given to SPA and policing over what has been a period of unprecedented change.\" The SPA said it is not possible \"at this stage\" to calculate a definitive figure for the financial settlement being offered to Mr Foley. It has, however, agreed with Mr Foley that the costs of the package will be made publicly available \"as soon as practical\" after his leaving date. Mr Foley said: \"The SPA has continued to evolve and improve since its inception in 2013 and strengthening the governance of Forensic Services is the next stage of that journey and one I fully support. \"Clearly the revised arrangements have significant implications for the CEO (chief executive officer) role I currently hold and following detailed discussions with the board since the start of the year I have chosen to seek early retirement. He added: \"I am confident that the authority and policing will continue to improve in the coming years and I want to thank all of the staff and officers who I have had the pleasure of working with over the past four years.\" Chief officer Although the CEO position is considered redundant, the SPA said it was seeking a 12-month secondee to act as chief officer for the SPA. The HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland report into the authority, authored by inspector Derek Penman, found \"positive signs of improvement\" in SPA board operations over the last 18 months, with improved relationships between the SPA and Police Scotland and the development of the Policing 2026 strategy described as a \"major milestone\". But it was highly critical of the approach which had led the SPA to meet in private. Mr Penman said the \"recent parliamentary scrutiny and media concerns over openness and transparency have weakened public confidence in the SPA and detracted from its ability to perform its statutory function\". He described the decision to hold meetings behind closed doors as \"precipitous\", and said it \"should not have been implemented\" until signed off by the board in full. Mr Penman welcomed the decision of the board to revert to holding meetings in public and publishing committee papers in advance, but wrote: \"I am aware that some board members continue to maintain that their decisions to implement private meetings and publish papers on the day of the board were essentially correct. \"There is a fundamental need to listen to the views of stakeholders to maintain public confidence, and on this occasion the SPA has failed to do so until pressed by parliamentary committees. \"The SPA must recognise the legitimate interests of parliament, local authorities, staff associations, the press and the wider public in the scrutiny of policing in Scotland.\" 'Gross misconduct' The SPA describes its role as \"to maintain policing, promote policing principles and continuous improvement of policing, and to hold the Chief Constable to account\". Police Scotland's chief constable is currently the subject of an inquiry over allegations of gross misconduct. Phil Gormley had faced calls to step aside while he is under investigation by the police watchdog. BBC Scotland understands the probe concerns an allegation about bullying.

Other taxes Elsewhere, the replacement system for stamp duty in Scotland (Land and Buildings Transaction Tax) is also being revamped with the amount that buy-to-let investors or holiday home buyers pay on a second residential purchase going up from 3% to 4%. The Scottish government's Small Business Bonus Scheme is maintained, while the non-domestic poundage rates paid by businesses will see a\" below-inflation increase\". Local authorities will be allowed to increase council tax levels by up to 4.79%, and there will be cross-party talks about ways of replacing the council tax in the next parliament. Spending Health was the big winner with the Scottish government proposing an increase of almost £730m in health and care services, with much of the money being passed on in so-called \"Barnett consequentials\" from Westminster as a result of spending commitments by the UK government south of the border. Education spending saw a real-terms increase including a £180m pot to raise standards in schools. Almost £500m has also been committed to aid the expansion of the early learning and childcare sector. Support for business comes in the shape of £5bn commitment for capital investment to be spent on modernising Scotland's infrastructure, including a new £50m fund for regenerating run down high streets. Initial funding of £130m towards the establishment of a Scottish National Investment Bank has also been earmarked. Public sector pay increases of 3% for those earning up to £36,500 have also been proposed, while those who earn between £36,500 and £80,000 will see their wages increase by 2%. Separate to the draft budget, it has been announced that MSPs will receive a 2.3% increase taking their salaries to £63,579. Mr Mackay also said Scotland's 32 local councils will receive a real terms increase in both revenue and capital funding, taking the local government budget to £11.1bn. The Scottish government has also committed more cash to the £2.9bn justice budget, claiming the police resource budget will be protected in real terms. What else has he announced? Other spending proposals in the document: £2m has been set aside to tackle \"food insecurity\" in the school holidays, while £5m will go towards supporting 2,000 women return to work following a career break. Elsewhere, the government's external affairs budget - which \"supports the promotion of Scotland and its interests at home and abroad\" - will increase from £17.2m to £23.9m The \"Government Business and Constitutional Relations\" budget has increased from £2.4m to £12.1m Spending on the provision of free sanitary products in public places is proposed to jump from £1.2m to £2.8m next year. The public agency for checking criminal records, Disclosure Scotland, sees its budget drop from £14.8m to £11.4m. Highlands and Islands Enterprise sees its budget fall by £10m to £61. The state-owned Glasgow Prestwick airport will be loaned another £6m in 2019-20, taking the amount of public money tied up in the Ayrshire airport to over £50m. Fiscal forecasting The independent economic forecaster the Scottish Fiscal Commission has produced forecasts on economic growth for the coming years and is predicting economic growth of 1.4% this year and 1.2% in 2019, which it says reflects \"stronger recent economic performance, a more positive prospect for earnings over the next few years\". The commission forecasts that £15.2bn of the Scottish Budget will be raised by devolved taxes in 2019-20. Income tax raises the most revenue, forecast to be £11.7bn in the next financial year. The Green deal After talks went down to the wire, Mr Mackay secured support for his plans from the Greens just hours before the stage one vote on the budget. The agreement will see the Greens back the minority SNP government for the third year in a row. It includes: Some of the changes - like the tourism tax and workplace parking levy - will not take effect in the coming year, but will be incorporated into future budgets.",

But Scottish Natural Heritage, which issues the licences, said it was \"not really having any detrimental impact\". Beavers gained protected status in May last year. Killing them or removing their dams can only be done under licence to prevent serious damage to agriculture. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) said the licences had been restricted to a \"fairly small proportion of occupied territories in and around Tayside\". A new report showed that 87 beavers were shot and 83 beaver dams were removed between May and December last year. Farming leaders have raised concerns about the damage caused to agricultural land from beavers' dam-building. SNH said it was considering opportunities to move beavers from \"high to low conflict areas within existing catchments\" to improve the resilience of the existing population. Its head of wildlife management, Robbie Kernahan, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"We've seen beavers expand their range by about 20% on an annual basis prior to even being protected. \"I think we can be comfortable this level of offtake is sustainable and it's not really having any detrimental impact.\" The two main beaver populations are in Knapdale in Argyll, and in Tayside and Forth. The animals were introduced into Knapdale as part of a licensed trial in 2009. In Tayside, beavers were first recorded in the wild in 2006, most likely through escapes from captive collections or after being released illegally. 'Heavy culling' Scottish Wildlife Trust conservation director Sarah Robinson said the report revealed \"alarming figures.\" She said: \"The trust see that as deeply concerning, because it's such a substantial proportion of the beaver population on Tayside. \"We know there's still a relatively small number of beavers and they're quite localised. \"So the impact of the cull on this protected species could be quite significant, and of course any continued heavy culling would put the future of the species in Scotland at risk.\" Ms Robinson welcomed the recommendation to move beavers within their existing range. She said: \"There would be a particular benefit in moving animals into the fringes of this range in the Tay and the Forth catchments. \"Doing this could help expand their range, and close the gap between Scotland's two beaver populations.\"",

Her museum, like every other institution, is not immune from the havoc wrought by Covid across Scotland's cultural landscape. Currently only open five days a week, it is attracting about 800 visitors a day, compared to the 6,000 that it welcomed on its busiest day after opening in 2018. Ms Bell, who was named as the new director in July and took up the role last month, said there was \"no point in shying away\" from the financial impact of the pandemic. She welcomed the recent £1m in emergency funding that V&A Dundee received from the Scottish government, which is also giving the museum £1m per year in its first decade. She said: \"It's not just on things like ticket sales - the entire events programme that we were running and able to use as levering commercial income is gone. \"And as many cultural organisations know, the impact of giving from other donors is also more difficult than potentially it's ever been. \"So we will use that money really, really well. We'll use it to sustain ourselves but also to have that thriving future.\" Born in Dundee and raised in nearby Newport-on-Tay, Ms Bell returns to the city after leading Paisley's cultural regeneration plans. Before that, she developed Scotland's first culture strategy in a decade at the Scottish government. One of the strategy's aims is to \"recognise each community's own local cultures in generating a distinct sense of place, identity and confidence\". I ask why V&A Dundee has not yet connected with the city in the same way as Dundee Contemporary Arts or the McManus Gallery. Ms Bell admits the museum needs to do more to develop \"our root system within the city\". However, she says: \"We're only two years old and I think sometimes we have to remind ourselves of that. \"We have a long, long enduring lifespan and we've still got a lot of work to do and we'll do it to the very best of our ability.\" She also highlights the \"extraordinary\" plaza outside the museum, which last year hosted BBC's Antiques Roadshow and will soon be joined nearby by British artist Lee Simmons' giant humpback whale sculpture. Some have suggested that more local content would be welcome in V&A Dundee. Ms Bell said: \"It's not just about thinking about a museum in terms of the content it produces within its own walls. \"I'm really interested in working with the city and lots of different partners and what emanates from us, work we can do across different sectors, with health, wellbeing, social justice, all those areas design is relevant to.\" Another concern is the continued criticism from some visitors that V&A Dundee lacks the content that its massive structure promises from the outside. One comment on a popular travel site describes a recent visit as \"a pleasant experience but with little meat on the bone to keep me interested\". Ms Bell said: \"I think there is so much to think about in those concerns, and I take them really seriously.\" However, she describes the museum's space as a \"very open sanctuary\", which is something special \"in these terrible Covid times\". She said: \"It just feels like a beautifully well-designed place in Dundee for everybody to feel welcome.\" Covid restrictions have also changed the museum's layout, with an exhibition and pop-up shop now occupying the space vacated by its ground-floor café. Ms Bell said: \"We're very interested in thinking about how we are imaginative with the space, how we innovate what exhibition-making is, and how we celebrate the power and the joy of the architecture. \"But, also change the programme so people want to come back if they're living locally too.\" Despite the challenges in the future, Ms Bell sounded a note of optimism for the months ahead. She said: \"I think what we've proven is in the darkest of times, people turn to creativity. \"I think culture can be pioneering and progressive in how it helps us through this in a practical way. \"But also in terms of who we want to be as a society and a country as we work our way through these very difficult times.\"",

Ministers want customers to get more details about where they eat or buy food and say this will raise standards. The proposals follow E. coli outbreaks in Wales which led to calls for a tougher stance. Under the scheme, businesses will be rated with a score of between zero to five based on standards on how the food is prepared, cooked, cooled and stored, as well as the condition of the premises. All food businesses, including supermarkets, will be required to display their score in a prominent position or face fines of up to £1,000. Ratings will also be available online. The Welsh government launched a consultation into the food hygiene rating bill. In August, Conservative assembly leader Andrew RT Davies said E. coli outbreaks were too frequent. He was speaking after a kebab house in Cardiff was closed temporarily when a number of people fell ill in an outbreak of E. coli O157. 'Low scores' The Welsh government said a mandatory scheme has been backed by Prof Hugh Pennington who chaired a public inquiry into the 2005 E.coli outbreak in south Wales. This was the second biggest E.coli outbreak in the UK and which resulted in one death, 150 cases including 31 hospital admissions and long-term health consequences for several children. Health Minister Lesley Griffiths said: \"It is already a legal requirement for food businesses to meet hygiene regulations set out in food law, but businesses are not currently required to display their ratings and those with low scores generally do not display them. \"Compulsory display of hygiene ratings will encourage all businesses to improve their procedures and drive up standards.\" About 30,000 businesses in Wales would be covered by the scheme which could be in operation by 2014. Currently, more than 13,500 have been rated under a voluntary scheme operated by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), although it is estimated that only one in three display their rating. The Welsh government said the FSA will continue to make funding available to Welsh local authorities so they can carry out advisory visits to businesses to help them improve their food hygiene ratings. Karen Morrisroe, who became seriously ill after an E. coli outbreak linked to a fish and chip shop at Llay, Wrexham two years ago has welcomed the move. \"I'm all in favour of a mandatory system,\" she told BBC Wales. \"I know it could put some people out of business but if this is done properly it will provide customers with better protection.\" During the outbreak it emerged that the fish bar had been given a 0 out of 5 rating by council officials after an earlier food hygiene inspection. Its former owner Ramazan Aslan was later jailed for eight months for hygiene offences. The takeaway is now under new management not connected with the previous owner. Dr Prysor Williams from Bangor University said a compulsory scheme would force food businesses to \"up their game\". \"There may be some resentment by businesses, by industry, but ultimately I think it is in their interests as well,\" said the lecturer in environmental management. \"It will help reward those businesses that are actually implementing good hygiene practises, because they will help draw more business. \"Consumers will vote with their feet. If these businesses are obliged to put up their score, and a score of zero is put on the door, then obviously you will choose to eat elsewhere. \"That will effectively force them to improve their game.\" A Consumer Focus Wales survey in October showed that 94% of people in Wales thought it should be compulsory for food businesses to display their food hygiene rating score. Consumer Focus Wales director Maria Battle said: \"The consultation presents a great opportunity for the people of Wales to voice any concerns they have about food safety and to press the government to make further improvements.\"",

		"InputText": "By Nick DermodyBBC News The film recounts the battle of Rorke's Drift in 1879 when some 150 British soldiers held off around 4,000 warrior tribesmen whose land they had invaded. It was an event which saw 11 Victoria Crosses awarded, more than for any single battle before or since. That may in part be due to Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli wanting to draw a veil over the huge defeat at Isandlwana earlier on the same day when a column of 1,800 well-armed British military were put to the spear. However, an analysis of the citations will show that the award of each VC was justly deserved. But, since it was made nearly half a century ago, the British movie about the seven score or so of men who successfully beat off a Zulu army has become a 139-minute cinematic treasure. It has sparked an entire industry about what might be an otherwise largely forgotten colonial war and, for most people, it might as well be a documentary of what happened. At least that is the view of Bill Cainan, curator of the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh, based at Brecon, Powys. That is where the soldiers were based and in the film were portrayed as a fundamentally Welsh regiment, with Rhondda Valley-born actor Stanley Baker in the leading role. Except that they weren't, says Mr Cainan, who himself served in the army for 37 years. Industrialisation Although the regiment had been based in Wales for six years by the battle of Rorke's Drift, they were still titled as the 24th Regiment of Foot (2nd Warwickshire Regiment). For generations the regiment had recruited from the big strong farmhands working in the fields of Warwickshire and neighbouring counties. But in the wake of the rapid industrialisation of Wales, and the south Wales valleys in particular, the Army had moved the regiment's base to Brecon to recruit from unskilled industrial labourers. Yet even then no more than a third of the men in the regiment at that time would have considered themselves Welsh, says Mr Cainan. He gives a lecture on Saturday at the National Army Museum in London on how the Anglo-Zulu War was received in Wales. It is the sort of occasion where he comes up against the many myths perpetuated by Zulu, he says. He said: \"Stanley Baker just wanted to put some Welshness into it. He played the regiment as being the South Wales Borderers whereas it was still the 2nd Warwickshire Regiment. \"Mind you, it took the Army nine years - two years after Zulu war - to rename it, to reflect its geographical location.\" Perhaps one of the defining moments of the film is the singing of the Welsh marching song, Men of Harlech. As the surrounded British troops wait for the final onslaught, the opera singer Ivor Emmanuel, starring as Private Owen, leads them in a stirring performance to counteract the Zulu war chants. 'Expected to die' Even though it is one of the memorable moments in the film, it probably never happened. Mr Cainan said: \"Most of the battle was at night. It finished at approximately midnight. \"The soldiers started with 24,000 rounds of ammunition. By midnight they were down to a 600-round box and any rounds they had left in their pouches. At midnight, they all expected to die. \"But by midnight the Zulus had shot their bolt. The battle had started at 4.30pm and they had taken quite heavy casualties. \"The British fire did not seem to be diminishing. The Zulus had jogged 15 miles to get there and swum a river in flood and they were relatively old regiments - in the uThulwana regiment the average age was 50. \"The Zulus were great warriors but even they had their limit. By midnight they thought 'that's it, finished'. \"If they had tried one more attack, they probably would have succeeded. The film does not convey that.\" Yet Zulu has done marvellous things for the memory of the war, said Mr Cainan, even if it has also obscured somewhat the truth behind a battle that is still honoured by descendants on both sides. He said: \"It's a duality. Without the film, we would not have the interest in the Anglo-Zulu War, \"The medals that were issued would not be worth the money they are now.\" The two main Victoria Crosses, awarded to Lieutenant John Chard [played by Baker] and Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead [played by Michael Caine] are probably worth up to four times more than others VCs, he said. \"But because it is such a well-crafted film, many people treat it as a documentary. \"When you start to say 'that's not quite right' the eyebrows start to raise and people say 'but I've seen the film!'.\" The line \"Zulus - thousands of 'em\" is uttered in the film by Colour Sergeant Bourne [played by Nigel Green]. Green was middle-aged, but Bourne was only 24. In fact, he was one of the youngest colour sergeants in the British Army. And the line of his - that people misquote, actually - did he say it? Who knows? Bill Cainan will be a speaker at the Zulus! Anglo-Zulu War Celebrity Speaker Day at the National Army Museum in London on Saturday 25 February.",

The charity said 70,000 people suffer domestic abuse in Wales every year. A conference on the issue is taking place on Monday. It coincides with the launch of the Welsh government's Christmas and New Year domestic abuse campaign and also follows the announcement that Clare's Law, which allows people to check whether new partners have a criminal record for domestic abuse, is being expanded to cover all of Wales and England. 'Huge challenge' Frances Beecher, chief executive of Llamau, a charity working with vulnerable young people and women, said they were looking at being able to talk about the domestic abuse \"to very young people, right the way through primary school, up until comprehensive school\". She said the issue should be discussed \"in a gentle, sensitive way\". Ms Beecher added: \"Domestic abuse is a huge challenge. \"There are potentially over 70,000 people across Wales affected by domestic abuse. \"This is a huge challenge for everyone to come together, but also to critically analyse our own services - whether that's police, whether that's third sector providers, whether that's education or social services - looking at how we can better provide for people and families.\" The proposal was welcomed by Sarah Crown, editor of parenting website Mumsnet, who said the issue had been debated on the website. \"They've discussed it at some length and there's a broad agreement that anything to raise awareness of this kind of thing has got to be beneficial,\" she said. \"There was some anxiety around the fact it would have to be talked about very sensitively, there should be an agreement on the language used and that would have to be looked at very carefully.\" One victim, Natalie - not her real name - was abused by her former partner. She told BBC Radio Wales: \"It's imperative that the word of abuse, mental and physical, should be known all over the country just to make everyone aware of what's happening. History of violence \"To speak about it more is important... regardless of age.\" She added: \"For a young man or a young girl to just try and control somebody else is not acceptable.\" A Torfaen council spokesman said the conference was a \"call to action\" from Welsh government, councils and charities to deal with domestic abuse with a coordinated response. Ann Beynon, commissioner for Wales, Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: \"This conference will bring together service providers from across Wales with the aim of finding innovative partnership approaches to tackling domestic abuse in all its forms.\" The conference follows news that Clare's Law is being extended. The scheme is named after Clare Wood, who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend George Appleton at her home in Salford, Greater Manchester, in February 2009.

The take-up is 77% - 6% higher than in Scotland and 8% above Northern Ireland. Rhodri Williams, Ofcom director for Wales, said public funding to roll out the Superfast Cymru programme across Wales had \"transformed\" the picture. \"Things have improved due to the substantial amount of public investment that has taken place,\" he said, with financial backing coming from the EU, the UK and Welsh governments. But other findings in the report showed that Wales had the lowest availability of 4G services across the UK, with just under a quarter (23%) of adults having a 4G service in May 2015. Deputy minister for skills and technology Julie James welcomed the report and added: \"Fast and reliable internet connections are vital.\" The findings are part of Ofcom's 10th annual review of the communications market in Wales. Television The report showed people in Wales are the television addicts of the UK. On average they spend four hours 11 minutes watching TV a day - more than anywhere else in the UK. Despite people in Wales continuing to watch significantly more television than those in the UK as a whole, the average time they spent watching broadcast television declined by 12 minutes in 2014. And the report found the Welsh had more pay TV than anywhere else in the UK with seven in 10 households buying extra channels. The BBC's television services continue to perform better in Wales than in any other nation for reach, share, viewing hours and viewer appreciation scores. Internet and social media More than one in five Welsh adults said they were \"hooked\" on social media. Six in 10 adults in Wales have a tablet computer in the household compared to less than half (45%) last year. But internet users in Wales cited the laptop as their most important device for going online. Most internet users in Wales said they spend around 21.2 hours online per week with more than half of all Welsh internet users spending time on social networking sites on a weekly basis. The use of Twitter was higher among online adults in Wales (48%) than England (40%), Scotland (32%) and Northern Ireland (33%). More than eight in 10 online adults in Wales said they have used Facebook. Radio People in Wales consume more radio than the UK as a whole - and they listen for longer. In 2014, radio services reached 94.5% of the adult population in Wales. Wales continued to have the highest share (59%) of listening to BBC services and the lowest share of listening to local commercial radio (26%). Close to half of adults in Wales (47%) who listen to radio have a digital radio set.",

Philip Pearce from Bridgend said he was vulnerable and it was \"ridiculous\" he could not sign up. The Welsh Government said it was urgently working to resolve the issue. Mr Pearce said: \"I tried to shop at Sainsbury's this morning and because I am classified as vulnerable, I thought I'd be able to register quite easily. \"I went onto the UK government's web page but found I couldn't sign up because I live in Wales. \"It's ridiculous.

She said: \"There's no chance at all of getting a delivery... \"Unfortunately we can't [sign up for priority] as it's available to England but not to Wales, which is annoying.\" 'Working hard' She said some small local shops were now doing deliveries: \"They are trying their hardest, but we don't shop there and we don't know what they sell.\" Sainsbury's has said it is doing its \"absolute best\" to make online delivery slots available to vulnerable customers.

A Welsh Government spokesman said: \"We are working with retailers, through the Covid-19 retailers forum and retailer associations, to resolve this issue as a matter of urgency. \"People with certain long-term health conditions are being advised to stay at home and adopt a series of 'shielding' measures for at least 12 weeks. \"They will receive a letter setting out the steps they need to take. \"We will make sure this group of people can get food, medicines and other essentials. \"For those who cannot turn to family, friends and local support networks, we are working closely with the Welsh Local Government Association and the Wales Council for Voluntary Action to ensure support is available locally.\"",

		"InputText": "By Natalie GriceBBC News Dr Chris Jones, deputy chief medical officer, said there was a \"real risk\" of a third wave of Covid-19 cases if restrictions eased too quickly. He was speaking after Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled a plan to end lockdown in England, by 21 June. The Conservatives have called for the Welsh Government to produce a roadmap for the end of the Covid lockdown. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Jones said there were \"probably greater risks\" now than at previous points in the pandemic because of the more transmissible variants. He told Claire Summers that opening schools \"has a definite effect on the R-rate\", and how the new variants will affect infections is \"uncertain\". \"It is absolutely impossible in my view to say that on any one date in several months, that this will be the situation,\" he said in response to a question about Mr Johnson's announcement. \"I think we have to take things step by step.\" He said all the UK's chief medical officers \"share the same view about the risks associated with relaxing restrictions,\" but added politicians had \"very difficult decisions\" to make. But he said \"messaging to the public\" was \"very important\". \"To send the message that everything is going to be back to normal in a few months time, I think, is almost too open,\" he said. \"We are not out of the woods yet. There is a real risk of a third wave if restrictions are eased too quickly. \"We hope, from our cautious approach and step-by-step approach, will minimise the risk of that.\" How does Wales compare to England? In England, the prime minister has set out a four-stage plan beginning on 8 March, with \"at least\" five weeks between each of the stages to allow time to assess the impact of relaxing some restrictions to be felt, and prepare for the next stage if possible. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has published a \"cautious\" framework to ending restrictions there, with the reopening of shops, bars, restaurants, gyms and hairdressers expected to start from 26 April. She said it was hoped that Scotland's stay at home restrictions could be lifted on 5 April. However, Northern Ireland has renewed lockdown measures until 1 April. When do schools return? Children in England are due to return to the classroom on 8 March. In Wales, Foundation phase children, aged three to seven, are returning to school this week. If conditions regarding the virus continue to improve, all primary years will be back in school on 15 March, along with pupils in exam years 11 and 13, and some pupils in years 10 and 12 who are due to sit exams. However, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said not all of those secondary-age pupils would be back in full time, which she hopes will happen from 12 April. In Scotland all primary pupils and S4 to S6 secondary students could return to school from 15 March, but pupils in the first three years of secondary school are unlikely to return until after Easter. Can I visit my relative in a care home? From 8 March in England, one nominated person will be able to visit a care home resident, but there is no date for this in Wales, where care home visits remain banned. Care Forum Wales is working with the Welsh Government to \"formulate a safe policy for visiting\". Someone who is very keen to see visits start is Jen Sutton. Her mother Liz Jones is 82 and lives in a care home in Aberystwyth. Ms Sutton, who lives in Cardiff, is an only child and used to visit her mother regularly until the pandemic struck. \"I haven't seen her indoors since March and the only other visit I've had is 20 minutes in a garden pod end of July, beginning of August. Then they closed down again for various reasons. I've seen her on Skype but it's not the same,\" she said. \"I'd just like to see her through a window. If it meant me isolating for 10 days beforehand I would do that. I don't particularly want to go in. I'm quite happy to wave through a window. \"It's a human right isn't it, to see your family. It's not too much to ask.\" When will shops reopen? This is one of the areas where Wales could be moving more quickly than England. On Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said some non-essential shops and hairdressers could reopen on 15 March. But this has raised questions over prioritising this when large numbers of secondary pupils will remain unable to return to the classroom. England is due to reopen all shops on 12 April, while in Scotland the provisional date is 26 April. Who can I meet? For most of us the rules for who we can meet indoors remain limited to the people we live with. Until 27 February, only those who lived alone - or are single and live in a house share - and single parents had been able to form a so-called \"support bubble\". However, now families with babies are now allowed to meet up with one other household to form a bubble. It means anyone with a child under the age of one can form an exclusive support bubble with another household, allowing them to meet indoors, and stay overnight in each others homes. The rule change also allows teenagers - aged 16 to 17 - who do not live with an adult to form a support bubble with another household. Who can I see outside the home? Since Saturday 20 February , people in Wales have been able to exercise in groups of four, but only from a maximum of two households, and it must be exercise rather than \"socialising\", Mr Drakeford said. In England, from 8 March people can exercise with one other person not from their household, but they will also be allowed to meet outdoors on a park bench for a chat, for example, expressly for the purpose of socialising. In Scotland a provisional date of 15 March has been given for four people from two households to be allowed to meet outdoors. Then from 29 March, people in England will be able to meet in groups of up to six people from different households, or two groups from two households. They will be able to do this in private gardens as well as public spaces. What about having a holiday? Discussions have been ongoing in Wales with the tourism sector about a potential reopening at Easter. The country is again likely to be ahead of England on this, although no firm date has been mentioned yet, and Mr Drakeford said it would not be opened \"in one go\". Mr Johnson's roadmap has holidays in self-contained accommodation used by one household being allowed from 12 April at the earliest, which misses the school holidays completely. How long do we have to stay at home? Mr Drakeford has talked of easing the stay at home requirement at the lockdown review on 12 March, if cases continue to decreased. However he has said there could be a \"stay local\" requirement in place, as there was in the arrangements during the autumn for people to remain in their local authority area. Mr Johnson has said the stay at home rule in England will end on 29 March but people should stay as local as possible, while in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said she hopes stay at home restrictions could be lifted on 5 April. What about sport? At present, only certain elite athletes in Wales are allowed to train together. No dates have been mooted so far to allow people to get together for sport, including more individual distanced pursuits like golf or singles' tennis. There are also no plans to reopen gyms. In England, outdoor sports venues and formally organised outdoor sports can resume from 29 March. Gyms will be able to open from 12 April at the earliest. While in Scotland the possible date for reopening gyms and swimming pools has been mooted as 26 April. Can I get married or form a civil partnership? Currently in Wales, only register offices and places of worship are open to perform marriages and guests are limited to the number who can be accommodated in the venue under the 2m social distancing regulations for different households. From 1 March, licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen for ceremonies. In England, six people can currently attend but ceremonies are limited to those in exceptional circumstances, such as those who are terminally ill. From 8 March, all weddings with six people will be allowed. This will expand to 15 people on 12 April and 30 people on 17 May. Can I get a pint at the pub? Not any time soon in Wales, in a nutshell. There has been no date mooted, and Mr Drakeford said closures were unlikely to be revoked in the next six weeks. In England, it is hoped people will be able to visit outdoor seating in restaurants and pubs from 12 April, and move indoors from 17 May. Meanwhile in Scotland pubs could reopen on 26 April.",

He said: \"The situation as it is that we have agreed a deal in principle on taking over the club. \"That deal involves third parties. As soon as the third parties are ready, the deal can go through. \"I'm confident that if we all keep level heads and stay calm in this situation and Geoff Moss keeps the club going while the deal is completed, then Wrexham FC has a very bright future.\" Mr Harris said the the trust's constitution prevented it stepping in with emergency funding to keep the club running before a deal was sealed. The Supporters Federation is appealing for fans to help pay the players' wages. It said it was fully behind the trust's bid to buy the club and understood the trust could not use its money to pay them. \"This emergency fund will help for the interim period between the club being taken over by the trust and the ground by the university,\" it said.

But the UK government wants to change the rules, and she is expected to take advantage of that and keep her name on the regional list if the ban is lifted. However, Education Minister Leighton Andrews, who holds the seat, called her candidacy a \"stunt\". Ms Wood, who is originally from Rhondda and still lives there, made the announcement in a speech to mark her first year at Plaid's helm. The speech in Cardiff focused on the economy and call for the devolution of the benefits system. But attention is likely to focus on her plans for the 2016 assembly election when she hopes to break new ground for her party in the south Wales valleys. Rhondda is a traditional Labour stronghold, although Plaid won it at the first assembly election in 1999. Ms Wood has stood for parliament in the seat and lost to Labour twice. Her selection as a candidate will have to be approved by local party members. She told BBC Wales that the community where she had lived almost all her life was important to her. \"It's an area that faces major challenges which I think can be put right with the right set of policies under a Plaid Cymru government,\" she said. \"As things stand the ban [on dual candidacy] is still in existence. The ban was in existence when I made the decision to contest a constituency seat and until that is changed I'm working on the basis that we are where we are.\" Her speech, which marks a year since she became Plaid's first female leader, set out economic policies to allow Wales to \"thrive\". She said: \"When I was elected as leader of my party I made it clear that I wanted to be judged on one issue and one issue only - the economy.\" A party policy commission on the economy had highlighted five areas for \"strategic intervention\". These include improving public transport, establishing a national energy agency, creating a publicly-owned Bank of Wales, devolving the welfare system and ensuring more public-sector contracts go to local businesses. Mr Andrews, who beat Plaid into second place in 2011 with a 6,739 majority, said: \"Standing in Rhondda is no more than a political stunt. \"It's clear that she plans to get back into the assembly on the regional list and the people of the Rhondda will soon see through that.\"",

She said a cross-party group wants to \"force the government to do the right thing\". The UK government has denied that MPs were led to believe the cut would come into force in April. But former UK sports minister Tracey Crouch resigned claiming her colleagues had delayed the plans. Ms Crouch stood down after Chancellor Philip Hammond said in the Budget the cut in stakes from £100 to £2 would come into force in October 2019. She said pushing back the date was \"unjustifiable\" and it could cost the lives of problem gamblers. Speaking on Monday, Carolyn Harris, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on fixed odds betting terminals, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We're going to be tabling a new clause and amendment to the Finance Bill and force the government into doing the right thing.\" The Welsh Labour deputy leader said there was a \"very realistic chance\" that MPs would back bringing in the cut to April 2019 when they discuss the Finance Bill. \"There's a huge feeling in the House that this is the wrong decision and we need to implement it as a matter of urgency.\" She added: \"Iain Duncan Smith [the Conservative MP] and I have become a big tag-team on this. We've not strong-armed, people have very willingly given us their consent.\" Ms Harris' amendment is due to be tabled late on Tuesday. A vote could take place next week - Ms Harris is hoping the government will concede before her amendment is debated on the floor of the House. Fixed-odds betting terminals generate £1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry, according to the Gambling Commission, and taxes of £400m for the government. Currently, people can bet up to £100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games such as roulette. Anti-gambling campaigners say the machines let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social, mental and financial problems. But bookmakers have warned the cut in stakes could lead to thousands of outlets closing.",

Nigerians are particularly sensitive to the health of their president after then President Umaru Yar'Adua sought medical treatment in Saudi Arabia in 2009. His failure to hand power to the vice-president and the lack of information about his condition led to widespread anxiety. He died in office in 2010.

Hackers broke into film company Sony's computers, and weeks later threatened to target any cinema which screened the film. An FBI investigation concluded that North Korea was to blame for the cyber attack. North Korea responded angrily, with Kim Jong-un calling President Obama a \"monkey\". What do we know about his ambitions? Four insiders offer their insight into what Kim Jong-un wants. 'Survival': Foreign journalist Jean Lee Jean Lee was born in America to South Korean parents and grew up hearing stories about Korean families separated by the war in 1953. A few years ago, she became the first foreign journalist to open a bureau inside North Korea. She was in the crowd when Kim Jong-un was first introduced to the Korean people at a military parade, and says he has had to work hard to establish his own power base. \"When he came out there was just a complete sense of shock and awe among the people at the plaza. They had never seen a picture of him. They had only really known of his existence, officially, a few weeks earlier. \"It was quite a shock to see somebody so young who was being groomed to be the next leader. He was not the oldest son, so wasn't the obvious shoo-in. There's clearly something about him, ambition, perhaps a kind of ruthlessness, some qualities that his father saw in him that he thought would carry this country into the next generation.\" The world saw that ruthlessness a year ago, when he ordered the execution of his uncle for allegedly trying to overthrow the state. And the regime is known to use violence to quash dissent among ordinary people too. But Jean Lee says it would be a mistake to think Kim Jong-un maintains control only through fear: \"One of the things that I've seen on the ground over the past couple of years is all the construction of these skating rinks. There's actually a skateboard park, the ski resort of course that opened last year, massive projects. I see all of this as an investment that they're making in their future. He is a young man. If he is going to win the support of the future generations of North Koreans who are going to be his power base, he's got to find a way to win their loyalty and this is part of that.\" 'A stronger economy': Businessman Geoffrey See Geoffrey See is a Singaporean who has been travelling back and forth to North Korea for the past seven years, working with young entrepreneurs. He says North Koreans are now thinking more innovatively about the economy: \"About six years ago when we first started our programme, our counterparts would often start off with a very long spiel about socialism and how this is the system they have and they are never going to change it. \"In recent years instead of saying that, people talk about... trying to bring in what's best from overseas, and try to adjust it to fit into the system. So I think that's a very interesting change in terms of thinking.\" Where this new investment is being targeted is also interesting. \"If you look at the economic zones that North Korea was investing in, one of the key areas is Wonsan. So this is an economic zone on the east coast of North Korea. It faces Japan and it borders South Korea. So it is kind of almost the furthest location you can have from China. So we believe that it's part of this broader aim to balance off Chinese economic influence in North Korea.\" Kim Jong-un has also been making overtures to Russian President Putin. Two years ago, Russia wrote off 90% of North Korea's debt. But Geoffrey See says there aren't many foreign investors willing to engage with the country's idiosyncratic business environment: \"We would email the North Koreans two, three, four times and we [wouldn't] get a response, and we used to get very worried about it. We wondered if they are reading our messages, if things are moving ahead. \"We would go in like three months later from the first set of emails. When we meet with them we ask them, 'Did you receive our emails?' The response is always like, 'Oh, you are coming in three months' time, we didn't feel the need to send a response because we can just chat when you're back in here'.\" 'The big prize: reunification': Supporter Kim Myong Chol Kim Myong Chol was born and lives in Japan, but is ethnically Korean. He has been to North Korea more than 20 times in the last 40 years, and says he has met representatives of the country's elite as well as, in his words, the two Kims - Kim Jong-un's father and grandfather. He hasn't met the third Kim yet, but praises his \"guts, determination and intelligence\". Some describe Kim Myong Chol as an unofficial spokesman for the leader. \"What makes him different from the two Kims,\" he argues, \"is that he will succeed in getting what he wants. The reunification of Korea, without foreign interference. Eventually the US will leave Korea and the Korean peninsula will be re-unified. \"[The US will] realise the futility, the senselessness of American military presence in Korea. North Korea [will] become too strong for America. We have now nuclear weapons, we have intercontinental ballistic missiles, we have hydrogen bomb. \"We are victims of American aggression. North Korea is a most sanctioned country. Brutalised, criminalised, isolated by America.\" He insists Kim Jong-un's unpredictable behaviour is part of his strategy to fight back: \"North Korea is a very small country. The USA is a big country with nuclear weapons. How to defeat the enemy? Outsmart them. That's the only way North Korea can survive, outsmart America.\" 'Friendly neighbours': China analyst Yanmei Xi Yanmei Xie is senior China analyst for the International Crisis Group in Beijing. She argues that Kim Jong-un can do little without China's support. \"North Korea relies on China for survival. If China cut the fuel supply across the Yarlu River which is between North Korea and China, then the regime... will collapse in a matter of weeks. So Beijing plays a very crucial and vital role in the Korean Peninsula.\" And when North Korea does something that China doesn't like, its punishment is swift and exact: \"When there were reports and intelligence saying North Korea could be on the brink of a fourth nuclear test, China slowed down fuel supply and food aid. \"But before it did that, China looked into the fuel supply and harvest of grain and calculated the amount of reduction in order to make sure that the reduction would not cause instability. [This] was meant to send a signal of displeasure but not to destabilise the regime or cause real pain.\" This is because China also needs its neighbour: North Korea stands between China and the 28,000 US soldiers stationed in South Korea. \"North Korea used to be a military buffer for China in terms of heading off any potential advance of US armies. Now in the age of naval and air dominance of United States, a land war is not as important, but North Korea remains a political buffer in that it is a buffer between China and South Korea, which remains a US ally. \"So China shares interest of managing Kim Jong-un. But I think sometimes people confuse that with signs that China is ready to abandon the Kim Jong-un regime. But actually it's the opposite. China is... stabilising the regime... to prolong, to preserve the current status quo.\" The Inquiry: What does Kim Jong-un Want? was broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesday 27 January, 2015.

		"InputText": "By Vikas PandeyBBC News, Delhi The joint announcement followed a marathon meeting between Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow. It came despite spiralling rhetoric between the nuclear-armed neighbours, which had suggested increasing hostility. Earlier in the week, China's state-run Global Times had said Chinese troops would \"quickly deal a heavy blow to Indian troops, and they will be all annihilated\" if Delhi provoked a war. India, too, had upped the ante, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh saying \"there should be no doubt\" about the country's resolve to protect its territorial integrity. The statements reflected the reality on the ground: a hostile face-off between troops. In June they fought a deadly clash in Ladakh's Galwan Valley with clubs and stones which left 20 Indian soldiers dead. Both countries still have a huge deployment in the region where they have overlapping territorial claims - and overcoming their differences will not be easy. 'Ice breaker' envoy So, what made the countries agree to de-escalate, when few expected it to happen? Many observers, including Michael Kugelman, deputy director at the Wilson Center think-tank, believe that both countries were ready for a confrontation, but they also realised that a war, even a limited one, was not an option. \"It would have been catastrophic for both countries and the wider region. The economic stakes were too high to risk a war,\" he said. The fact that Mr Jaishankar served as ambassador in Beijing for many years and is known to share good relations with Chinese diplomats appears to have helped. It did break the ice, Mr Kugelman says, adding that personal relations often play a role in crucial diplomatic negotiations. Weather, an unlikely factor, may have also played a role. The higher ridges of the Galwan Valley become inhospitable in winters. Lieutenant General (retired) Vinod Bhatia, who served in the Indian army, says troops are used to operating in harsh conditions, but \"given a chance, both armies would want to avoid that\". Reports also suggest that Indian troops recently occupied some ridges overlooking Chinese posts. Neither country has officially confirmed the reports. \"India may have used this advantage as a bargaining chip,\" Lt-Gen Bhatia adds. Both countries also have many other crises to deal with. India's Covid-19 caseload continues to rise at an alarming rate and its economy is suffering. Any armed confrontation would affect the country's ability to overcome these issues. China, meanwhile, has tensions with the US and a host of other countries to deal with, as well as global condemnation of its controversial security law in Hong Kong. How soon could peace be restored? Analysts say it's difficult to predict. Yun Sun, director of the China Programme at the Stimson Center think-tank in Washington, says the joint declaration lacks details. Firstly, it doesn't mention the Line of Actual Control (LAC) - the de facto boundary separating the countries. \"Several points along the LAC are contentious where troops are still stationed, so there is no clarity on the resolution of these issues,\" she says. De-escalation takes time, says Lt-Gen Bhatia, and it will take longer in the current scenario. \"The area is too big and it will take time for commanders to come to an understanding. The military-level talks will happen when tensions are still high and emotions are raw,\" he says. Both countries want to maintain the status quo. And that is tricky, says Ms Yun, because the two sides define the status quo differently. \"Chinese troops have gone deep into the territory India claims, and there is no clarity if they will vacate those positions.\" What caused the escalation will also determine how quickly disengagement can happen. A major factor cited as a source of tension is a new road that connects Indian army stations in the region to a forward air base. But Ms Yun believes the road can't be the only source because its construction took 20 years and \"it wasn't a secret\". She believes many factors, including India's controversial decision to revoke a law that gave special status to the region and Washington's improving relations with Delhi, played a role. \"Beijing felt punishing India will give a warning to Delhi and Washington at the same time. But what they did not calculate was that India will refuse to back down,\" she says. China has been in diplomatic confrontation with a number of countries since US officials accused it of not controlling the coronavirus outbreak effectively. So, they became more aggressive, she says, adding that this was reflected in the statements of Beijing officials in recent days. Aggression has been a key factor in China's foreign policy - particularly in recent months. And Chinese state media often remind the country's neighbours of its superior military might. This happened during the stand-off with India as well - but only in the past few days. Officials in Delhi and Beijing were largely restrained in their comments in June and July, even after the Galwan clash that left the Indian soldiers dead. Mr Kugleman says this was because they didn't want to undo PM Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping's efforts in improving relations. The two have met 18 times since Mr Modi came to power in 2014. \"But it all came undone in recent days, and now it will be interesting to see how China and India sell the announcement to their people,\" he says. Ms Yun says China will find it tricky to reverse the rhetoric because \"it can't come across as weak or bullied by India\". Resolving these core issues, including unsettled disputes going back decades, along the LAC that stretches for 3,440km (2,100 miles), will not be resolved in a few days. \"So, it's a good start,\" Mr Kugleman says. \"Talks are better than no talks, but we just have to be cautiously optimistic.\"",

		"InputText": "By Michael BristowBBC News, Beijing The 17-year-old, named as Kelsang Wangchuk, was reported to have been carrying a photograph of the Dalai Lama as he set himself alight. This is the latest in a series of incidents this year at the Kirti monastery, in Aba County - called Ngaba in Tibetan - in Sichuan province. As well as the self-immolations, there has been a stand-off between residents and the security forces, and a row about a group of monks sent for re-education - an incident that even drew comment from the United Nations. China has reacted by tightening security at the monastery, launching a series of criminal prosecutions and criticising the behaviour of some monks. But it still appears to be struggling to assert its authority in at least this one Tibetan area. 'Worrying trend' News of the latest self-immolation came from campaign groups with contacts in the area. The US-based International Campaign for Tibet said the monk had set himself on fire on Monday as he shouted slogans against the Chinese government. China's state-run Xinhua news agency confirmed the incident had taken place, saying the police had immediately extinguished the flames. The monk had only slight burns to his leg, according to Xinhua. Another campaign organisation, Free Tibet, based in London, also reported the incident. \"A growing number of Tibetans clearly feel that this is the only way that they can be heard,\" said Stephanie Brigden, the director of Free Tibet. This is the fifth case of self-immolation in Tibetan areas of western Sichuan province this year, something Ms Brigden described as a \"worrying and absolutely unprecedented\" trend. Thubten Samphel, a spokesman for the Tibetan government-in-exile, said Tibetan Buddhism did not accept violence against other people or oneself. \"Whatever the reason for this, it's a very strong and desperate indication that the people there are totally unhappy,\" he said from the government's base in Dharamsala in India. 'Know nothing' It is not easy, though, to understand even what is going on in and around the Kirti monastery, let alone why it is happening. Kirti has a sister monastery in Dharamsala, and the two sets of monks keep in touch using mobile phones. \"It seems the monastery is under heavy police and military surveillance,\" said Thubten Samphel, adding that reports had come from this informal network between the two monasteries. But, in an indication of just how patchy those links can be, he said the government-in-exile learnt about this latest self-immolation only through international news reports. Telephone calls to the monastery and surrounding town glean little more in the way of information about what is going on in the area. Workers at hotels and businesses on Tuesday told the BBC they knew nothing about the monk who had set fire to himself. A person who answered the phone at the monastery was equally unhelpful. \"I don't know anything about it,\" he said. The Chinese government usually restricts journalists' visits to sensitive Tibetan areas - something the US government has recently complained about - so it is difficult to get on-the-ground information. And officials are almost always reluctant to talk openly about such incidents. \"Police are investigating the man's motives,\" was the curt comment in the Xinhua report about why this latest monk should feel impelled to set himself alight. Prosecutions But the Chinese government has not been passive - it has attempted to counter the discontent being displayed at the Kirti monastery. In August it sentenced three monks to lengthy prison sentences for helping another to kill himself through self-immolation in March. And earlier this year it ordered the \"legal education\" of monks at the monastery, an incident, among others, that resulted in queries from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. It wanted to know what was going on at the Kirti monastery and surrounding area. The Chinese government gave perhaps its fullest justification yet for its actions at the monastery in its reply to the UN. It accused the monks there of long being engaged in acts \"aimed at disturbing social order\", including vandalism and self-immolation. \"Some monks of the monastery also frequented places of entertainment, prostitution, alcohol and gambling, and spread pornographic CD-Roms,\" said the official document from May this year. China told the UN that forcing the monks into re-education was a \"showcase\" of how to manage religious affairs. Many at Kirti monastery appear to disagree with that view.",

Two officers were jailed in the Republic of Tatarstan in September after a suspect was mortally wounded while being assaulted with a bottle.

Mr Demerchyan and his brother-in-law worked on a residential bloc for Olympic volunteers between 25 March and 16 May.

However, they found police officers there instead, and were taken to a police station, she added. In custody, they were allegedly told to confess in writing to stealing building materials from the construction site.

The pro-government paper Izvestiya, however, hails the move as a \"turning point\" in Russian politics. 'Minority interest' \"Putin demonstrates delicacy ahead of the Olympics,\" political analyst Leonid Davydov tells liberal business daily Vedomosti. Talking to the same paper, another pundit, Yevgeny Minchenko says that the decision to set Khodorkovsky free is \"no risk for the authorities\". \"The parliamentary opposition is tamed, and opposition outside parliament does not exist,\" he explains. The same opinion is voiced in popular daily Moskovsky Komsomolets. Putin's decision \"will immensely improve the international media backdrop for the Sochi Olympics\", writes Stanislav Belkovsky. He explains that the former oil tycoon has \"ceased to pose a threat to the Russian president and to the regime\", as once released he \"is more likely to focus on repairing the damage done to his health by imprisonment and engage in public works of a non-radical nature\". Mikhail Khodorkovsky's fate \"has always been of interest to a minority of Russian citizens\", argues Lev Gudkov in Kommersant, \"the 25-30%... who are educated follow the news via independent sources and are therefore aware of the political context\". Forced to beg? \"Mikhail Khodorkovsky surrenders for pardon,\" says a headline in Kommersant, the most popular financial daily in the country. The paper quotes sources as saying that recently Khodorkovsky had \"a chat with security officials\" who told him that \"his mother, who has cancer, is getting worse and that a new criminal case will be launched against him very soon\". \"It was that conversation, which took place without lawyers present, that prompted Khodorkovsky to appeal to the president [for clemency],\" says the daily. A similar assumption appears in heavyweight centrist broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta. It cites a \"well-informed expert\" who claims that Khodorkovsky \"was approached by the prison administration, who assured him that were he to write an appeal for pardon, it would be immediately granted\". Pro-government daily Izvestiya sees the decision to release Khodorkovsky as a \"turning point\" in the history of Russia. The paper predicts the moment will have the same significance for the country as the end of the civil wars, known as Fronde, had for France in the 17th Century. \"Our Fronde is over,\" declares the paper's deputy editor Boris Mezhuyev. He argues that the \"symbolic\" end of the confrontation in society was \"marked by the amnesty given to participants in the 2011 and 2012 [anti-government] protests\" and \"most importantly\" by the pardon granted to \"the first and main leader of our local Fronde, businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky\". Other commentators, however, are not so optimistic. \"One should not expect that Putin's decision would have a significant impact on the Russian economy,\" analyst Igor Nikolayev tells financial RBK Daily. \"It's hard to imagine that the PR impact of pardoning Khodorkovsky will heal the wounds inflicted on the economy and society a decade ago. \"Investment won't start coming back, closed down and never-started enterprises won't be reborn, and those who have emigrated won't return,\" says an editorial in another business paper, Vedomosti. The daily argues that \"the system established over the past decade will continue to operate\", although \"the system no longer fears Khodorkovsky himself\", it adds.

The memorandum only makes clear what the birds have been singing from the rooftops for a long time,\" he writes. He adds that top civil servants should have a \"firm word\" to combat Mrs May's \"fatal habit of trying to sort everything out herself without any sense of priority\". The French business paper Les Echos agrees that Mrs May's \"refusal to delegate\" is as big a problem as alleged cabinet divisions, making it \"difficult to grapple with the titanic task of Brexit\". Enrico Franceschini of Italy's La Repubblica, thinks \"Brexit will collide with a wall built by the government\", while the economics editor of Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Marc Beise, complains that Britain appears \"completely unprepared\", and must \"either move ahead quickly with Brexit or reconsider its position\". 'Opening a door' Die Welt's business correspondent Nikolaus Doll is not alone in seeing in recent remarks by German Chancellor Angela Merkel signs she is looking for compromise on freedom of labour movement. While affirming her commitment to the principle in a speech on Tuesday, she added that there should be a debate about the speed with which migrants can claim benefits - a matter that \"not just the British criticise\", according to Doll. Les Echos agrees that Mrs Merkel \"opened a door\" over movement of labour, in an \"overture to Britain\". In Poland meanwhile, Tomasz Bielecki, Brussels correspondent of Gazeta Wyborcza, reports that Polish diplomats are worried about the \"hole\" Britain's departure could leave in the EU budget, of which Poland is the \"major beneficiary\". \"This is crucial for us,\" he writes, as it will require \"renegotiations that are less and less appealing to many countries, including those appalled at our attitude towards refugees\". 'Wooing Trump' Commentators are intrigued by Theresa May's policy towards Donald Trump, with most seeing a possible transatlantic alliance that may not be to the EU's benefit. The London correspondent of France's Le Monde, Philippe Bernard, thinks Theresa May may have a point in \"counting on Donald Trump to help her with Brexit\", and that London understandably sees a \"parallel between Brexit and Mr Trump's surprise victory\". Alessandra Rizzo of Italy's La Stampa also thinks Mrs May's \"dream\" of Britain becoming a world trade leader in concert with \"old allies\" is bound to try to enlist Mr Trump. Carlos Fresneda of Spain's El Mundo thinks Mrs May \"wasted no time\" in echoing Mr Trump's populist attacks on globalisation and large corporations in a recent speech to business leaders. Berlin's left-wing Tageszeitung complains that there appears to be no will in the EU to \"put Britain in its place\" and stop it \"undermining EU attempts to present a united front against Donald Trump\". \"The EU is not opposing Trump. Rather he and his friends in London are steering us,\" it says . 'Worst time for City' Eric Albert, writing from London for Le Monde, is not so sure. He says London fears Mr Trump might deregulate US financial markets at the \"worst possible time for a City already plagued by Brexit\", with many institutions preparing to move some activities to elsewhere in the EU or Wall Street. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung highlights the German Finance Ministry's statement about the growing number of London companies' inquiries about how to move to Frankfurt, adding that local politicians there are actively courting such interest. But a commentary by the paper's business reporter, Tim Kanning, considers Frankfurt's efforts lacklustre, adding that while banks may be \"sitting on packed bags\", their destination may not be Germany.

The coalition was thrown into doubt when the People's Party's then leader, Reinhold Mitterlehner, quit last week. \"It has to be accepted that the [People's Party] put an end to this coalition on Friday live on television. They made it quite clear that they don't want [to be in coalition] any more,\" Chancellor Kern said. \"I have difficulty picturing a scenario in which we could put together a stable minority government,\" Mr Kern added. Mr Kurz had said earlier that he would only be prepared to lead the People's Party if the position came with sweeping powers on issues including staffing. If the election goes ahead it could see the Freedom Party, which is currently riding high in opinion polls, enter or even lead a new coalition government. The coalition between the Social Democrats and the People's Party was meant to govern until September 2018. The two parties have governed Austria for decades, either alone or in coalition.

He said Berlin D2 was operating at less than 20% capacity at the time, was \"spotlessly clean\" and that food was served, temperature checks and details for contact tracing were taken on arrival and social distancing was maintained. However he said Berlin D2 would stay closed until an internal investigation into the incident is completed. Restaurants Association of Ireland CEO Adrian Cummins described the scenes as \"deplorable and despicable\" and a \"slap in the face to front-line workers who are putting their life on the line during this pandemic\". Mr Cummins said gardaí (Irish police) should take immediate action \"to stamp out this kind of behaviour\".

		"InputText": "By Adam EastonBBC News, Warsaw Her idea won a European Union prize that came with €10,000 (£8,700; $12,120). \"Firstly, I heard about the increase in domestic violence cases during the pandemic. Then I heard about a French initiative, where people go to the pharmacy and ask for a special mask that lets the pharmacist know they are a victim of domestic violence,\" Krystyna Paszko explained. \"I thought it was a brilliant idea, so I came up with the idea of selling cosmetics.\" In April, Krystyna, who was 17 at the time, decided to launch the fake online shop \"Camomiles and Pansies\" to sell those cosmetics. The idea is that the victim can hide requests for help from their abuser at home by appearing to be shopping online. When a victim writes asking to buy a cream, a psychologist responds instead of a salesperson and asks how long the \"skin problems\" have been going on for, or how the affected skin reacts to alcohol. If someone places an order and leaves an address, it is actually code asking for authorities to visit their home. After Krystyna openly wrote about her plan on her own Facebook page, she was inundated with questions. \"I thought it would only be for my friends, and friends of friends. I thought I would help maybe one person or two, but the shares on Facebook were big and it became really popular,\" she said. With so much interest, Krystyna contacted the Women's Rights Centre, a Polish NGO, asking for assistance. In response it provided psychologists and lawyers to work with the website. Since its launch, more than 350 people have contacted the website. Most of the victims are young, under 40, and about 10% are male. \"More younger women prefer to write on Facebook than to call on the phone, it's more natural for younger women to use Facebook chat. Most of the men writing to us are teenagers,\" she said. Krystyna credits her interest in human rights to her role in the scouts - she leads a Warsaw scout group and created its Facebook page. \"For many years I've been interested in human and women's rights, and because of that I read about the increase in domestic violence and wanted to do this. Before, I had created my scouting page. Scouting taught me how important it is to help others and to be interested in the world around me,\" she said. The initiative was one of 23 projects to receive the EU's Civil Solidarity Prize, a one-off contest offering €10,000 to reward civil society organisations tackling the consequences of Covid-19. The president of the Women's Rights Centre, Urszula Nowakowska, said she was \"very impressed\" by Krystyna's project. She said official police data does not show a rise in domestic violence cases last year, but calls to her organisation's hotline during the first few months of lockdown rose by about 50% compared with 2019. In July, Poland's Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro was criticised both at home and abroad when he said Poland should start to prepare to withdraw from the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, because its \"ideological\" nature threatened the traditional family model. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki subsequently asked Poland's Constitutional Court to decide the issue. In November, the justice ministry pushed through legal amendments allowing the police to expel perpetrators of abuse from the home. However, there is still no way to stop them from approaching their victims outside the home, at the workplace or during the school pick-up, Ms Nowakowska said. Poland introduced a promising multi-agency intervention system called the \"Blue Cards Procedure\" in 2010, but many have become disillusioned with it, she added. \"What I have observed in the last 15 years is that people are more eager to treat domestic violence cases as family conflicts, rather than a crime. I think this system is contributing a lot to that because it's not effective, it's very bureaucratic,\" she told the BBC. She said there are around 70,000 domestic violence cases annually in Poland, of which only between 13-14,000 are treated as crimes. When Krystyna found out she had won the EU's Civil Solidarity Prize she was pleased that a spotlight was being shone on the problem of abuse. \"It makes the public face this problem and makes people think about this,\" she says. She was pleased too for her team, who had worked hard to pull off the initiative - and for now they plan to keep it open.",

		"InputText": "By Gideon LongBBC News, Santiago Outside Chile, the general is almost universally vilified - remembered as a ruthless dictator whose military regime killed more than 3,000 political opponents, tortured many more and drove thousands into exile. But inside the country, views tend to be more nuanced. As the country marks the 40th anniversary of the military coup that brought him to power, attitudes towards Gen Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime and the Socialist government of Salvador Allende that preceded it remain complex and subject to intense debate. While most Chileans abhor the human rights abuses committed under his rule, Gen Pinochet still has a small but ardent group of right-wing supporters who regard him as a hero. They say that by ousting Mr Allende on 11 September 1973, the military prevented Chile from sliding into civil war and saved the country from becoming \"another Cuba\" - a communist state. \"The armed forces saved me,\" right-wing congressman Ivan Moreira told Chilean state television this month. \"They saved me from living under a regime, a Marxist dictatorship. Pinochet saved the lives of an entire generation.\" When Gen Pinochet died in 2006, about 60,000 people turned up to file past his coffin and pay their respects. Some were in tears. Others clutched bronze busts and photographs of the general. To this day, there is a museum in Santiago honouring his memory. It contains his military uniforms, his desk, his medals and his extensive collection of toy soldiers from the different regiments of the Chilean army. Mr Moreira says the Pinochet regime has had a bad press. \"How long are we going to carry on accepting that the history of Chile is written by the pen of the left?\" he asked. Mixed views \"I'm a child of the dictatorship,\" said Karen, a Chilean I met recently in Santiago. \"I grew up with both sides of the story. My godmother is a communist but my mother is pro-Pinochet. They are best friends but they never talk about politics. Never. \"I don't believe the dictatorship was that bad,\" Karen told me. \"It was a safer time on the streets for normal people. Now you go to the outskirts of Santiago and there are lots of drugs. There weren't back then. \"Some young people who didn't live through the dictatorship think that everything about it was bad. People of my age, who experienced it, can remember the good and the bad.\" A survey published by pollster CERC on the eve of the 40th anniversary commemorations gives some idea of where Chileans stand on these issues. While three-quarters of those polled said Gen Pinochet was a dictator, 9% said he would go down as one of the greatest leaders in Chilean history. According to the poll, 55% of Chileans regarded the 17 years of the dictatorship as either bad or very bad, while 9% said they were good or very good. More than a third of those polled either had no opinion or regarded the dictatorship years as a mixture of good and bad. Another poll, published in the country's leading newspaper El Mercurio on Sunday, asked Chileans if the state had done enough to compensate victims of the dictatorship for the atrocities they suffered. While 30% said yes, 36% said no. The rest were undecided. Nearly half of those polled (46%) said the state should find new ways of compensating relatives of the disappeared - victims of the dictatorship whose corpses were often dumped at sea or buried in unmarked graves. But over a quarter (27%) disagreed. Ideological split Right-wing historians in Chile use two basic arguments to defend the legacy of the Pinochet regime. Firstly, they say the coup has to be understood in the context of the time - that by 1973 Chile was a deeply polarised country on the brink of civil war and economic collapse. Secondly, they say that the free market reforms implemented by the military government in the 1970s and 1980s laid the foundations for the country's later economic prosperity. It is true that by 1973, Chile was in a sorry state. Mr Allende had been in power for three years and the country was increasingly split along ideological lines. A series of strikes by truck drivers and copper miners had weakened the economy. Right-wing paramilitary groups were sabotaging power lines and transport routes. Basic provisions like bread and flour were scarce. \"As early as December 1971, women took to the streets in what became known as 'the march of the empty saucepans' because of the problems they had getting hold of basic goods,\" says Adolfo Ibanez, a historian and columnist for El Mercurio. \"And in 1972 and 1973 the situation got worse.\" Evelyn Matthei, a right-wing candidate in forthcoming presidential elections, said this month that by September 1973, \"the immense majority\" of Chileans wanted to see the back of the Allende administration. Economic success The reasons for this animosity and for the economic turmoil of the time are still hotly debated. The right says Mr Allende's government was incompetent. The left says Chile's powerful and conservative business lobby, backed by covert funding from the United States, undermined the government. It was against this backdrop that the coup took place. After assuming power, the military government opened up the economy to the free market. Foreign mining companies, the assets of which had been expropriated under Mr Allende, were invited back into the country. State-owned companies were sold off. The education and pension systems were privatised. The right says these reforms helped Chile become what it is now: one of the wealthiest countries in Latin America. Just how much of Chile's prosperity is down to the policies of the Pinochet regime, and how much is to do with the policies of later centre-left governments and the country's vast mineral wealth, is still a matter of debate. Human rights This week's 40th anniversary has rekindled the debate in Chile over the rights and wrongs of the coup, the shortfalls of the Allende government and the legacy of military rule. Ultimately, though, for the outside world, the Pinochet regime is likely to be judged on its human rights record rather than its economic achievements. According to official figures, 40,018 people were victims of human rights abuses under the dictatorship and 3,065 were killed or disappeared. That remains by far the biggest stain on the Pinochet legacy.",

		"InputText": "Wyre DaviesRio de Janeiro correspondent Temperatures fluctuate wildly from one day to the next. Dark clouds roll menacingly across the sky and we have had several consecutive days of heavy rain in Rio de Janeiro area. As we move, moodily from one season into the next - there is a similarly dark, tempestuous mood on the streets. I have written on these pages recently about the infamous Black Blocs, how they regularly seem to hijack legitimate and largely peaceful political protests by teachers, state employees and others with a grievance in these volatile days. Now the Black Blocs have spied another target, the high-profile and high-stakes auction to sell off the rights to develop the immense offshore Libra oil field. Time of upheaval It is somewhat unfortunate for the Brazilian government that the Libra sell-off has been scheduled right in the middle of this period of social upheaval that has blighted Rio and other Brazilian cities of late. With only eight months to go before the World Cup, for the government to order the army onto the streets of Barra de Tijuca (the coastal strip to the west of Rio) is not a decision that will have been taken lightly. Riot police breaking up violent demonstrations is one thing but armed troops protecting the hotel where the Libra auction is taking place is another. They will provide images that Brazilian authorities would frankly rather the world did not see at such a critical moment. Workers from the state oil company, Petrobras, are out on strike over the bidding process - saying that Brazil is preparing to sell off its most valuable assets. That is, arguably, pretty far from the truth. Whoever wins the bidding process - almost certainly the company that is prepared to offer the highest proportion of profits to the Brazilian exchequer - will be required to pay an immediate up-front bonus of $5bn (£3.1bn) to the government. It will also have to operate its licence under pretty strict conditions, including a 70-30 partnership with Petrobras, in whose name all of the extraction of oil will be done. The head of Brazil's state petroleum agency, Magda Chambriard, is reported to have once said that she had hoped at least 40 international companies would join the Libra bid - paying an amuse-bouche of $1m each just to be at the table. In the end, only nine bidders stumped up the cash, among them three consortia from China for whom the availability of oil and access to Brazil's vast reserves is the important thing, not necessarily the price. Undefined anger No-one really knows who the Black Blocs are. In an interview earlier this week with a Brazilian newspaper, one member of the Black Blocs was reported to have admitted they did not really yet know what they were protesting for but they were incredibly angry with so many things in Brazilian society today. Selling off Brazilian oil to foreigners fits that bill quite nicely but it is so much more complicated. Brazil cannot do this on its own. Apart from its own financial and structural \"issues\", Petrobras doesn't really have the technology or expertise to develop Libra - a deep, offshore find under kilometres of rock and salt. Several foreign firms, large and small, are already active in Brazil, investing hundreds of millions of dollars to help turn Brazil into a major oil exporter. The billions, even trillions of dollars that Brazil would start to earn if and when Libra comes on line, should help to boost Brazil's once dynamic and recently laboured economy. But it would also hide a multitude of sins and ills. Corruption, inefficiency, bureaucracy and waste are still rampant in parts of Brazilian life and society. Many believe that is what the Black Blocs and this government, which wants to get re-elected next year, should really be railing against.",

		"InputText": "Wyre DaviesRio de Janeiro correspondent No country has done more than Brazil in recent years to tackle the previously rampant levels of deforestation but there is a good reason the agents have their guns drawn - we have seen statistics which show that rates of Amazon destruction are again on the rise. There are big profits to be made from illegal logging and the fraudulent clearing of rainforest for valuable cash crops and these helicopter patrols are often shot at. Trying to locate illegal logging operations in the midst of this dense jungle from the air is like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. Destroyed on the spot There are probably thousands of small illegal logging camps across the Amazon. Men armed with machetes and chainsaws, cutting down valuable Brazilian hardwoods are the foot soldiers in a highly profitable and dangerous trade. On the ground, the Ibama agents show little sympathy to the loggers. Those that are caught risk arrest, their camps are set alight and their machinery, including expensive tractors and other equipment, are destroyed on the spot. All of this might appear harsh but, says Maria Luisa de Sousa, the Ibama official who has been co-ordinating this month-long operation in northern and eastern Mato Grosso, the fight to save the Amazon is increasingly a fight against organised crime. \"You can compare it to the struggle against drugs trafficking. The crime and the criminals keep on adapting.\" As we wait for our helicopter to be refuelled before heading out on another mission she adds: \"They're getting even more sophisticated, using even bigger tools to deforest, which makes it even more dangerous for us.\". Everything felled We fly on, over virgin jungle, but also over immense fields of soya and corn, cash crops that have earned valuable export profits for Brazil in recent decades and also help to feed the growing population in the south of the country. Some of the most recent deforestation sometimes seems blatant and egregious. Down below we spot two huge tractors - the \"new beasts\" of the jungle. They are involved in one of the most destructive forms of deforestation in the Amazon. In this case, several acres of trees have been felled in a couple of days or weeks. Dragging a huge, steel chain between them, the tractors have felled everything in their path. New monthly figures show that deforestation rates in some parts of Brazil have almost doubled compared to last year. Those statistics also show that increasing amounts of wood are illegally taken from protected indigenous reserves. Threatening gangs Three hours' drive from the town of Aripuana, I spent two days with members of the Cinta Larga tribe. They may wear Western-style clothes and live in wooden shelters, rather than grass huts, but they mainly live in and off the forest. This is a reserve being increasingly invaded by illegal loggers - unscrupulous and sometimes threatening gangs who cut down trees by day and spirit away truckloads of wood by night. \"The loggers come in here for the valuable hardwoods that have already been lost elsewhere,\" says Amadeus. \"That's why the pressure on our land and all the indigenous lands around here is so strong.\" Read more about the concerns of Amazon residents. In some areas, its thought that as much as 80% of the timber felled is done so illegally - from state-owned or indigenous land. Back in Aripuana, there seems to be as many timber mills as there are coffee shops in Rome. It is in the sawmills that illegal or \"dirty\" wood with false certification gets mixed up with the legitimate industry. \"There's no way to tell which timber is legal and which is illegal after the chain is contaminated,\" says Greenpeace researcher Marina Lacorte. \"We're asking international companies and importers to stop buying timber from Brazil because there's no guarantee that official documents can guarantee the legal origin,\" she adds. Managed exploitation Such a move would surely be harsh on those legal timber companies who have nothing to hide about their operations. SM Wood & Laminates only deals in certified timber and in its yard huge, decades-old logs await cutting up for export. More than 50 people work at the plant in a region where 20 million Brazilians now live. Manager Vanderlei Nunes is frank and honest in his view that only by placing a monetary value on the forest, allowing managed exploitation of the Amazon - including indigenous areas - can the rainforest survive. \"I think that people in the south of Brazil and in Europe and the US think the forest is untouchable, but they forget that there are people living and working here,\" says Mr Nunes, who like many of those who now call the Amazon home, initially came here in search of work from other parts of Brazil. \"So until we find a formula for them to live from the forest - get an income from it and give it a value - then the Amazon problem won't be resolved.\" Last week in a highly publicised trip to Washington, Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff expressed her \"deep concern\" for the climate and in a joint press conference with US President Barack Obama, she made numerous pledges about the environment - promising among other things to stop all illegal deforestation. But many environmentalists are sceptical about her ability to deliver on her promises. Under tighter economic constraints her government has repeatedly cut environmental budgets, while the emphasis has often lent towards the right of Brazil to develop and exploit its resources over the need to protect biodiversity. As long as that remains the case and if President Rousseff fails to match the rhetoric in Washington with the appropriate resources, the future of this unique wilderness remains in jeopardy.",

It rained for just 30 minutes. \"After the rain, there was a silence followed by terrible thunder and lightning,\" says 63-year-old resident Cristina Inga. Her house was destroyed first by flooding, and then tonnes of rocks tumbled down from the mountain. \"We survived by escaping through the roof,\" she recalls. \"All the neighbours did the same; we all helped each other.\" When the landslide was over, their street was covered in mud and boulders over two metres (6ft 5 inches) high. The street they lived on ran along a wash, a natural watercourse which floods when it rains heavily in the Andes. It is by no means a place to build homes, but the people who live here are poor. 'No choice' \"I was born here, my parents settled on this land because we had no money\" Ms Inga explains. Her house had been destroyed three times before 23 March. She currently lives in a wooden shack but is proud to be the legal owner of the plot of land it is build on. As for the risks, she says: \"We don't move because we have nowhere else to go.\" What happened in Moyopampa earlier this year is seen by many as a sign of things to come. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the region may be facing the worst El Nino weather phenomenon in over 60 years between now and March. At risk The Peruvian government has already declared a state of emergency in more than half of the country's regions. Peru, along with Ecuador, are the two countries most directly affected by El Nino. In fact, it was Peruvian fishermen who named El Nino (The Child) in a reference to Baby Jesus because it used to arrive around Christmas time. But for the people of Moyopampa, El Nino's arrival is not something they look forward to. It is one of 107 places in Peru which the country's Civil Defence Institute (Indeci) has declared \"vulnerable\". Three million people live in these vulnerable areas and are at risk of losing everything to heavy rains, mudslides and flash floods. The government has set aside three billion Peruvian soles ($1bn; £0.65bn) to respond to the fall-out from El Nino and to support all sectors of the economy threatened by it. 'In God we trust' Previous El Ninos destroyed key roads and bridges leaving communities isolated and often desperate for help. So the ministry of transport is sending more than 1,000 portable bridges to different locations along Peru's coast. So far, most of the government's efforts have been focused on cleaning the beds of coastal rivers, building floodwalls in vulnerable locations and making sure there is enough equipment to help in case of floods, mudslides or any other disasters. On the day I visited the site of the Moyopampa landslide, local authority workers were removing debris which had been littering the street since March. Others were building floodwalls which residents hope will be strong enough to withstand the forces of nature. Ms Inga says she will only move if the government offers her family proper housing. In the meantime, she puts her faith in God. \"I am scared. We are scared. But in God I trust and he always has the last word,\" she says with conviction. But then, as if having second thoughts, she looks up at the sky and adds: \"But down here we should be the first ones to protect ourselves\".",

As BBC South America business correspondent Daniel Gallas wrote at the time, Mr Temer, had \"always been a kingmaker, but never king\". In a series of carefully plotted moves, Mr Temer clearly positioned himself as a rival president. Ms Rousseff accused him of orchestrating a coup against her. Daniel Gallas described him as \"a skilled politician intent on ending the Rousseff presidency and beginning a new era in Brazil\". Although the Brazilian public did not hit the streets to protest against Mr Temer, his approval ratings stayed in single figures. Political scientist Carlos Melo described society as \"disenchanted and demobilised\" during the Temer tenure. In the October 2018 election, he was replaced by the far-right Jair Bolsonaro. Bribery allegations Mr Temer was the first president in Brazilian history to have charges brought against him while still holding on to the top job. He was accused of being the head of a criminal organisation and of trying to obstruct the course of justice. Prosecutors said that back in 2006, when he was still a congressman, he created a bribery scheme that was still alive and well when he became president. His political group allegedly funnelled over 587m reais ($180m, £137m) from state-run institutions such as Petrobras and the Brazilian Lottery into the pockets of lawmakers. He was also accused of pressuring billionaire businessman Joesley Batista into buying the silence of two key witnesses that were co-operating with investigators from jail. Prosecutors said they had a mountain of evidence against Mr Temer, including video footage of a close aide of his receiving bags stuffed full of millions of reais in a restaurant in Sao Paulo. And two key witnesses have described how the ex-Brazilian president allegedly kept some of the bribe money for himself. Prosecutors say they even have a recording of Mr Temer listening to Joesley Batista brag about bribes the latter paid to judges and witnesses. Mr Temer has denied all the allegations, claiming he was the victim of \"coup plotters\" and survived two votes that stopped the investigations. However, on leaving office he lost his legal protection, leading to his arrest.",

The decision will end recent speculation as to whether the entire Saudi team could have been disqualified on grounds of gender discrimination. The public participation of women in sport is still fiercely opposed by many Saudi religious conservatives. There is almost no public tradition of women participating in sport in the country. Saudi officials say that, if successful in qualifying, female competitors would be dressed \"to preserve their dignity\". In practice this is likely to mean modest, loose-fitting garments and \"a sports hijab\", a scarf covering the hair but not the face. For the desert kingdom, the decision to allow women to compete in the Olympics is a huge step, overturning deep-rooted opposition from those opposed to any public role for women. As recently as April, the indications were that Saudi Arabia's rulers would accede to the sensitivities of the religious conservatives and maintain the ban on allowing women to take part. But for the past six weeks there have been intense, behind-the-scenes discussions led by King Abdullah, who has long been pushing for women to play a more active role in Saudi society. 'Subtle reform' In secret meetings in Jeddah, officials say a consensus was reached in mid-June between the king, the crown prince, the foreign minister, the leading religious cleric, the grand mufti and others, to overturn the ban. An announcement was ready to be made but then had to be delayed as the country marked the sudden death of Crown Prince Nayef. \"It's very sensitive,\" a senior Saudi official told the BBC. \"King Abdullah is trying to initiate reform in a subtle way, by finding the right balance between going too fast or too slow. \"For example, he allowed the participation of women in the Shura council [an advisory body] so the Olympic decision is part of an ongoing process, it's not isolated.\" The official acknowledged that to refuse to let women take part would have looked bad on the international stage. \"Partly because of the mounting criticism we woke up and realised we had to deal with this. We believe Saudi society will accept this,\" the official said. It is not the first time a Saudi monarch has backed a controversial reform against domestic opposition. King Faisal, who introduced television in the 1960s and was eventually assassinated, insisted on introducing education for girls. Today, Saudi women graduates outnumber their male counterparts.",

		"InputText": "By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent The explosions killed at least 140 people, mostly civilians, and injured over 500. More than four days on since the attack - which was widely reported to have been an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition - the Saudi authorities have yet to publicly accept responsibility. The UK, which has a long-standing and lucrative defence and trade relationship with Saudi Arabia, has taken the unusual step of requesting \"oversight\" of the ongoing investigation into the attack. Will this be enough to dampen the growing condemnation of US and British military support for the Saudi campaign? Unlikely. Tobias Ellwood MP, the Foreign Office minister for the Middle East and the man who has to periodically stand up in Parliament to defend Britain's arms sales to the Saudis, is due to hold sensitive talks with Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel Jubair as well as the Yemeni president and the UN Special Envoy for Yemen. At stake is more than just an explanation of how such a horrific death toll was incurred in a single attack at the weekend. For the UK, this is also about the whole nature and rationale of its controversial strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia, which campaigners want immediately curtailed. Unsuccessful war In March 2015 Saudi Arabia went to war in Yemen at the head of a coalition of 11 countries. Its aim was to reverse the takeover of the country by Houthi rebels, who are supported by Saudi Arabia's regional rival Iran, and to restore the UN-recognised President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and his government to power. Armed with state-of-the-art US and British warplanes and their munitions, Saudi Arabia's air force and its allies have complete air superiority in the skies over Yemen, meaning they alone can carry out air strikes. These have failed to dislodge the Houthis from the capital Sanaa and from much of the heavily-populated west of Yemen. The damage inflicted on civilians has been catastrophic. The UN blames the air strikes for causing 60% of the estimated 4,000 civilian deaths. The Houthis are far from blameless. They and their allies among the forces loyal to the ousted Yemeni leader Ali Abdullah Saleh are accused of shelling densely populated areas, laying mines indiscriminately and contributing to the humanitarian crisis that now afflicts the country. They have also embedded themselves in the civilian population, exposing non-combatants to the risk of attack. Round after round of peace talks have failed to reach a compromise deal between the Houthis and the legitimate - but now deeply unpopular - Yemeni government which clings to a corner of land around the southern port of Aden. Ceasefires have been announced, and then quickly fallen apart. War crimes? The Foreign Office is at pains to point out that Britain is not a part of the Saudi-led coalition. But the fact is that British and US military hardware is sustaining the Saudi campaign and Yemenis know it. The US also provides intelligence and refuelling for the coalition. Even before Saturday's bombing of the funeral hall there were accusations that Saudi Arabia's air strikes in Yemen constituted a breach of the Geneva Convention and were possibly war crimes. The Saudis insist they abide by a strict code, the Law of Armed Conflict, and have never deliberately targeted civilians, a claim disputed by many Yemenis. The Saudis also undertake to investigate allegations that its warplanes have killed civilians through an 11-nation body called the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT). 'Criminal judging his own crime' And hereby lies the problem. The Saudis say the JIAT operates to exactly the same high standards as similar investigations carried out by US and other Western militaries. Although the JIAT has admitted to some targeting errors, several of its members are the very same countries that are part of the Saudi-led coalition. Hence the jibe on social media that their findings carry as much weight as \"a criminal judging his own crime\". Hence Britain's request to have what it calls \"oversight\" (the Saudis prefer to call it \"assistance\") into this latest incident. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has said if it transpires that civilians were knowingly targeted last Saturday then the UK \"could review\" its defence relationship with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis have promised total transparency. That, in theory, should reveal who, if anyone, gave the order to bomb the funeral, knowing that senior Houthi rebel leaders would be present, and crucially whether or not they knew that large numbers of civilians would be hit. The Foreign Office minister's talks on Thursday could be uncomfortable for all sides.",

Looking forward to Friday,\" he tweeted. Trump vows to end 'American carnage' Trump's angry call to arms Full text of Trump's inauguration speech It's unclear whether the president-elect actually wrote the speech himself, but the content was pure Trump: the same populist message that resonated throughout the primaries and the campaign. \"Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people,\" he said at the beginning of his remarks. For some on Twitter, it bore an eerie similarity to the Batman villain Bane's speech in The Dark Night Rises, so much so that someone posted a 10-second mash-up of the two. But such snarky reactions, warned Fox News commentator Guy Benson, underestimate how popular his rhetoric is with Trump supporters. \"People panning the speech still don't seem to understand how resonant the 'I will never ignore you' theme has been, and still is,\" he wrote, referencing Trump's many callouts to those who feel left out of American progress. Trump spoke of a country whose citizens had too long been ignored by the coastal elite: \"Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\" He painted a picture of a broken and damaged country, dotted with rusting-out factories \"like tombstones\", city streets plagued with \"crime and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen too many lives,\" and the wealth of the middle class \"ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world\". It was an unusually bleak speech for an inaugural address. One democratic strategist called it \"startlingly angry\". Conservatives were more mixed. According to MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, the speech was not intended to follow tradition: \"Donald Trump's speech was not an inaugural address. It was a primal scream aimed at Washington, DC.\" Author Hugh Hewitt called it \"authentic, determined, almost grim\". He wrote, \"I expected more joy, but it cannot be said that POTUS @realDonaldTrump said anything he hasn't said before. He has a plan and it's going to roll out fast.\" Others were sceptical of the breadth of those plans. Trump said the country was poised to \"free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow\", as well as \"eradicate from the face of the Earth\" radical Islamic terrorism. Writer Ben Shapiro expressed doubt about Trump's plans to both take power away from DC, and use his position as President to steer trade and create jobs. \"These cannot both be true,\" he wrote. Many also noted that it's easy to campaign as an outsider, railing about America's problems, but harder to lead, when one must find solutions. \"After three months in which Trump is president and it's still the same Washington, that speech is going to seem wildly imprudent,\" wrote Noah Rothman, assistant editor at Commentary Magazine. Commentator Mary Katherine Hahn thinks voters aren't interested in sweeping rhetoric. \"I am unabashedly ideological. The country is not. His message is populist & popular. His opponents dismiss that at their political peril.\" Pollster Frank Luntz said President Trump seemed to pivot, if not in tone then at least in substance: \"President Trump's inaugural speech was the best delivery I've ever seen from him.\" A more well-known conservative kept mum on his opinion. When the Washington Post asked George W Bush what he thought of the speech, he merely replied, \"Good to see you.\" One high-profile Twitter user was an unabashed fan.

		"InputText": "House of Representatives conservatives have filed articles of impeachment in an effort to oust Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The articles were introduced by Representatives Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan, who accuse him of stonewalling their requests for information. Mr Rosenstein denies the accusations. The articles of impeachment, which were filed on Wednesday evening, criticise Mr Rosenstein for allegedly failing to comply with requests for documents relating to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. \"Rod Rosenstein has been in charge of the Department of Justice as the agency has made every effort to obstruct legitimate attempts of congressional oversight,\" Mr Meadows said in a statement. Mr Rosenstein has overseen the investigation since Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself last year. Impeachment would have to be approved by a majority in the House and backed by two-thirds of the US Senate to convict Mr Rosenstein, which makes the plan a long shot. Who is Rod Rosenstein? Within weeks of becoming deputy attorney general in April 2017, Mr Rosenstein found himself in controversy after a memo he wrote was cited as the reason for President Trump's decision to fire FBI chief James Comey, who was investigating Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 US elections. Mr Rosenstein then appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to take over the inquiry. Earlier this month, the Department of Justice charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democratic officials during the 2016 vote. Although Mr Rosenstein has said there is no evidence they \"altered the vote count or changed any election result\", the announcement came just before Mr Trump's controversial summit with President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. Analysis BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Two of the most conservative members of the House of Representatives have their press release and flurry of media coverage for introducing articles of impeachment against Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. That's probably all they will get. The motion, as introduced, is unlikely to see any kind of a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan, along with many other Republicans, don't want it. They know a real push for impeachment would tear their party asunder. Even if it does get a vote, and even if Mr Rosenstein is impeached, two-thirds of the Senate would have to support removing him after a trial in the chamber. The chances of that - which would require a significant number of Democrats in favour - are less than zero. That doesn't mean those who want Robert Mueller's Russia investigation to continue unimpeded should breathe easy, however. The president might claim that the impeachment resolution shows Mr Rosenstein is too embattled to continue his duties and replace him with someone who would clip the special counsel's wings. In April Mr Trump was reportedly itching to swing the axe on his deputy attorney general. Now, Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows could be helping to sharpen the president's blade. What is the Mueller investigation? President Trump's campaign team has been accused of colluding with Russia to influence the outcome of the presidential election. In 2016, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had used a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media in an attempt to turn the election against Hillary Clinton. Thirty-two people have now been indicted, including four members of Mr Trump's campaign team and 25 Russians. Both Mr Trump and Russia have denied the allegations, with Mr Trump repeatedly describing the investigation as a \"witch hunt\".",

But the university said the funds would help students facing \"urgent financial needs\" because of the pandemic. Harvard is rated the world's wealthiest university with an endowment fund valued at $40bn. At Tuesday's coronavirus briefing, Mr Trump told a journalist: \"I want Harvard to pay that money back, OK? If they won't do that, we won't do something else. \"They have to pay it back, I don't like it. This is meant for workers, this isn't meant for one of the richest institutions, not only, far beyond schools in the world. They got to pay it back.\" In a statement that followed, Harvard acknowledged receiving its $8.6m through the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (Cares) Act that Mr Trump signed last month.

The college tweeted: \"Harvard has committed that 100% of these emergency higher education funds will be used to provide direct assistance to students facing urgent financial needs due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\" The university said it had already provided financial assistance to students with travel, living expenses and online education amid the pandemic. But Harvard disputed the president's suggestion that it had received aid through the Payment Protection Program, a fund intended as a lifeline for businesses struggling amid the pandemic. Harvard said it had instead benefited from the stimulus bill's Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, which disburses money based on an institution's overall number of students and how many lower-income students are enrolled. The Cares Act reserved $12.5bn in federal aid to about 5,000 colleges and universities. Harvard was not the only elite university to receive a windfall under the stimulus. Princeton, which has a $26bn endowment, is getting $2.4m, while Yale - endowment $30bn - is receiving $6.9m. The US Senate on Tuesday approved another $330bn of emergency relief funds to help small businesses stay afloat during the pandemic after the original aid package of $350bn ran out of money last week. The PPP was designed to help so-called mom-and-pop stores keep staff on the payroll during the coronavirus emergency that has left 22 million American workers claiming unemployment benefits. But instead of going towards such small businesses, nearly $250bn of the initial stimulus went to publicly traded companies with market values topping $100m, according to analysis from Morgan Stanley, an investment bank.",

		"InputText": "Three women have recently come forward with accusations of sexual harassment against Democrat Andrew Cuomo. In his first public comments on the allegations, Mr Cuomo said he felt \"embarrassed\" that his actions made the women feel uncomfortable at work. Mr Cuomo asked the public to wait for the \"facts\" before drawing conclusions. The New York attorney general has opened an investigation into the allegations and will file a report on the findings. The governor said he would not resign, despite calls from within his own party for him to step down. What is Cuomo accused of? A former top-level aide to Mr Cuomo, Lindsey Boylan, claimed the governor touched her without consent and frequently made inappropriate comments about her appearance. In an essay published last month, Ms Boylan accused Mr Cuomo of kissing her on the lips and asking her to play strip poker while on his private jet. A second former aide, Charlotte Bennett, told the New York Times that the governor peppered her with personal questions that were clear overtures to a sexual relationship. \"I understood the governor wanted to sleep with me,\" she said. In a statement following Mr Cuomo's press conference, Ms Bennett's lawyer described the governor's statement as \"full of falsehoods and inaccurate information\". Debra Katz disputed Mr Cuomo's claim that he was unaware he had made any of the women uncomfortable, saying Ms Bennett reported the \"sexually harassing behaviour immediately\" to the governor's chief of staff and chief counsel. \"We are confident that they made him aware of her complaint\", Ms Katz said. A third woman, photographer Anna Ruch, said the politician touched her face and asked to kiss her at a wedding. The exchange was captured on camera. A #MeToo moment for Democrats Analysis - Nada Tawfik, BBC News, New York When asked what assurances Mr Cuomo could give that there weren't more women who would lodge complaints, he didn't really answer directly, instead repeating that he never intended to make anyone feel uncomfortable. But that is a question probably weighing heavily on Democrats who, having taken a strict view of these kinds of allegations in the past, are now facing their own #metoo test in relation to one of the biggest stars in the party. Mr Cuomo had been praised and admired globally for his response to the pandemic and his daily informative briefings. Now he's being cast in a different light and many are questioning his authenticity. Not only is he facing an investigation into sexual harassment claims by the NY Attorney General's office, but also a federal investigation into how he handled data on nursing home deaths, undercounting the true toll. Now that his Covid response doesn't look so sterling, and more women are coming forward, the political future of this three-term governor in the Democratic party may be in peril. What did Mr Cuomo say in his apology? Mr Cuomo has been widely criticised for not yet addressing the allegations publicly. After calls for his resignation intensified earlier this week, he used the end of Wednesday's coronavirus press conference to address them. He said that hugging and kissing people was his \"customary way of greeting\" people, something he learned from his father, former New York governor Mario Cuomo. But he acknowledged times had changed and he had \"learned an important lesson\". \"It doesn't matter my intent. If the women were offended by it then it was wrong. If they were hurt by it, I apologise.\" \"I fully support a woman's right to come forward. And I think it should be encouraged in every way,\" Mr Cuomo continued. But \"wait for the facts before you form an opinion\", he urged. What other political problems does the governor face? The mounting scrutiny on the governor follows Mr Cuomo's admission that he made a \"mistake\" in withholding data about Covid-19 nursing home deaths in the state. An inquiry by the state's attorney general found a dramatic discrepancy between reported deaths and the official tally. More than 15,000 New Yorkers in care homes have died since the start of the pandemic, the highest in the country. But until late January the state's health department had logged just over 8,500 fatalities.",

		"InputText": "By Tara McKelveyDecorah, Iowa Guy Nave, an academic with a Yale PhD, moved to Decorah nearly two decades ago. The Iowa town seemed idyllic. It had stone buildings, a train depot and Victorian homes that looked like gingerbread houses. Then, shortly after starting his job at a local college, he locked himself out of his house. He was rattling a patio door when police showed up. The officer had received a call, and was told \"someone who didn't look like they belonged in the neighbourhood was walking around the house\", Nave recalls. That person was a black man - that person was Nave. There were other incidents. He was pulled over a dozen times for minor violations during his first year living in the town. He focused on work and tried to ignore those incidents. Then, in May 2020, George Floyd died while in police custody and townspeople organised a Black Lives Matter march, the first of its kind. The town was waking up. 'We cannot close off from what's happening' Small towns are slow to change. A point of pride here is that glaciers missed Decorah, located in north-eastern Iowa, some 12,000 years ago, leaving it with rolling hills - a topography that dates back eons. It had been stuck in time culturally, too. Until recently, racism was rarely discussed. Floyd's death affected people here deeply, however, and sparked a movement. \"It changed Decorah, in a way where they cannot close off from what is happening all around,\" says Maria Leitz, an educator. But not everyone reacted in the same way. \"People were really sad about it,\" says Leitz. \"But I was really mad about it.\" As the trial of Derek Chauvin - the former police officer accused in Floyd's death - unfolds, she pays attention, and watches some of the testimony. \"I do hear snippets,\" she says. But she has tried to limit how much she sees: \"It's just so emotional.\" With the trial underway, and as more protests take place in Minneapolis, people here are fighting racism with new energy. Leitz is now part of a committee - Decorah Human Rights Commission - a group that was established in 2006 to investigate housing and other complaints, but which had languished. \"We're sorting out what Decorah can do,\" she says. She and other members of the commission have encouraged business owners to put specially designed, black-and-white \"All Are Welcome\" stickers on windows, promoting an accepting environment. In addition, Leitz helped to organise the town's Black Lives Matter march, and made posters: \"My sign said: 'Change.'\" Not everybody marched but most supported the idea, reflecting a trend of open-mindedness. More than half of the people who live in rural areas said they sympathised with those who protested in the wake of Floyd's death, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. While I was driving through Iowa, the country song, Undivided, played, often: \"Why's it got to be all white or all black?\" Leitz was born in El Salvador, and grew up in a town near Decorah. When she was a child, she says, people called her racial slurs. She left town, lived abroad. One recent afternoon she stood in a field with a friend, also an activist, and looked at the green hills - the landscape that brought her back. One benefit of her activism has been her new friend, Nikki Battle, who works for an insurance adjuster, and has biracial children. Battle nods, saying: \"We fell into a really beautiful friendship.\" 'These issues can't be on the backburner' People here say that their town embodies decency, a place where someone will dig your car out of a ditch if you slide off the road. Marnie Carlson, a school counsellor, describes it as \"a really safe little community\". On a recent morning, she chased her daughters, Marit, four, and Daphne, two-and-a-half, and their Old English sheepdog, Rosie, in a park. Still, she says, small towns can be \"pretty insular\", and the protest march was a milestone. \"We need to say: 'Hey, even though we're largely white, that's why we need to care about this movement,'\" she says. \"Just because don't have a lot of racial diversity, doesn't mean we're going to isolate ourselves from what's going on around us.\" In a town that is 93% white, filled with people of Norwegian heritage, racial injustice has, until now, not been an issue for the majority. \"Most people haven't really met a person of colour,\" says Jeremy Meyer, who handles billing for a logistics monitoring company. \"I think it's something that you just don't think about.\" Then George Floyd was killed, and people watched as he took his last breath. Maren Beard and her husband, Tom, were having coffee in their farmhouse, when she clicked on the video: \"Yeah, I mean, I immediately kind of went into a pretty intense, a very physical response. I started sobbing.\" On a recent morning, her border collie, Noche, chased sheep, and geese flew across a grey-blue sky. Floyd's death changed her, she says: \"I think it was a wakeup call, for sure. These issues can't be on the backburner. They are something we need to think about all the time.\" Still, some complain. A construction worker, asking me not to use his name, says he resents the way that store owners are asked to put the black-and-white \"welcome\" stickers in their windows: \"Now, it's: 'Oh, I won't come to your business because you don't have a Black Lives Matter flag. Stuff like that.\" But, as veterans of the movement know, change takes time, especially in a small town. Guy Nave lives around the corner from his old house, in the neighbourhood where he was once told that he did not belong. The town has a long way to go, but he sees a path, one forged with affection and concern for others. \"There is no way out of the degradation of racism, the pain, the injustice, without love,\" he says. Later, he barbecued jerk chicken in his yard. Funk music played on a loudspeaker, in a neighbourhood that seemed, at least on that evening, welcoming to all.",

The public went down one flight of stone stairs and then there were three long arches.\n\"At the end of one of the long arches was a little tiny stage. That's where the Beatles performed 292 times.\n\"I remember it being very highly charged with excitement. The music sounded even more exciting [than the previous gigs] because The Cavern was this little squashed space so the music sounded a bit louder, a bit more exciting and a bit more vital. About 20 to 30 people were there.\n\"The Beatles were the complete package - they didn't just have a great singer, they had two great singers. They always did harmonies right from the very first time I saw them.\n\"They could probably only afford two microphones, and so when one was doing the lead singing the other two were facing each other on the mic, and it was quite charismatic, it was nice to look at. They had a camaraderie about them.\n\"I never heard them singing one of their own songs because they were just a straight covers band at that time, as was everybody else in Liverpool.\n\"The standard songs that they sang - them and the other bands in Liverpool - were [by] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly. The sound that I very clearly remember the Beatles playing in the Cavern was a Chuck Berry riff.\n\"As well as doing the stock standards, the Beatles were a bit different because they were better at playing complicated chords. The Beatles were a bit more adventurous.\n\"It wasn't just the music and the singing, it was their lack of respect for the audience. At the Cavern for those first few gigs, they were quite irreverent to the audience and other people. They were sort of the first punk band. The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage.\n\"They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn't give a serious answer, and that's how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that's why I think they liked it in the Cavern.\n\"They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren't trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose.\n\"That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them.\n\"Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn't really concentrate on doing any work.\n\"Just in a few weeks they'd gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you'd seen them, not many people didn't go to see them again.\n\"They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I'd dumped them.\n\"They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal.\n\"I wasn't the only one. I think the ones who thought that they'd discovered them were a little clique and really did give up on them when the masses found them.

		"InputText": "Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region.\nFor many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration.\nMr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame.\nA mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught.\nTo use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over.\nBut he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore.\nThe diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma.\nSince 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism.\nDomestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime.\nHe was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship.\nHis message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised \"lowlanders\" in Oromia and Ogadenia.\nHis concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order.\nMeasured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring.\nThe much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele.\nBut it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty.\nThe democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed \"work in progress\", has long stalled.\nSince the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents.\nWhy West will miss Meles\nObituary: Meles Zenawi\nLife in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi\nA plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time.\nFeeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival.\nHe orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents.\nHis death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising.\nThat said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus.\nThe opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up.\nMr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically.\nHe is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums.\nHe did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable.\nNot in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse.\nFrom the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought.\nMany embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called \"new breed\" of African leaders.\nThe Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests.\nHe swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to \"tame\" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991.\nThe two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea.\nHostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border.\nIt is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension.\nThat would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond.\nIn Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia.\nThe death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia.\nThere are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview.\nSuch fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia's history and political fragility.\nHowever, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia.",

		"InputText": "\"Did you set this up?\" Salford City Reds owner Dr Marwan Koukash asked, at the start of the station's rugby league hour this week.\nThe extravagant millionaire has grabbed the ailing Reds by the scruff of the neck and set about building a dream in arguably the sport's most crucial year.\nHaving ruffled feathers with his breathtakingly bold bids to sign Sam Tomkins and Adrian Morley, Koukash has promised to make the Super League strugglers the biggest rugby club in the country within three to four years. What he has definitely done is make people talk about Salford again.\nFar from being a prickly atmosphere in the studio, there appeared to be real warmth between the extrovert racehorse owner, the man he wants to coach his club - Brian Noble, and the rugby league legend he wants to sign from Warrington - Adrian Morley.\n\"The more Marwan's the merrier, the better,\" said Noble, the former Great Britain and Bradford Bulls coach still waiting for the right opportunity to return to the sport. \"You just need passionate people with some substance behind them to push the game forward. His passion fills you with enthusiasm, you want to get going and get cracking.\"\nThose comments will have been music to the ears of the fiercely ambitious Koukash, who learned the art of hard work during three years in a refugee camp in Jordan.\nHe admits he would be honoured for Noble to coach the team he is attempting to assemble at Salford. Another Brian - the Australian Brian Smith - is the other frontrunner.\nI understand Noble is keen to work with Koukash, but only if he is convinced the dream of this businessman, tempted into the sport by the RFL's chief executive Nigel Wood, can become a reality.\nA similar discussion about ambition and available funds saw Noble drop out of the running for the Castleford Tigers job before the appointment of Ian Millward, so Salford fans should not expect this to be a done deal.\nKey to the 'Good Doctor's' dream - he was labelled the 'Mad Doctor' during his outlandish early claims of racehorse success - is his campaign to raise the sport's £1.8m salary cap. Koukash has, for the past few weeks, been lobbying to lift the limit that a club can spend on players to something nearer £2.5m.\nHis argument is that this will not only make the rugby league a more attractive proposition for the best players in Australia and halt a talent drain to rugby union, but even reverse the process and tempt union players to league.\nNoble agrees that the cap may need a rethink - it was introduced to stop clubs overspending. But the only man to coach a club to three Super League Grand Final victories believes we might now need a carrot to bring in the bigger names to raise the sport's profile.\nHow much of a financial risk would this be?\nThis is a time the sport cannot even attract a title sponsor for Super League - a situation branded unacceptable by the St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus, who cites his own club's deal with tea-makers Typhoo as proof that the sport can pull in the blue-chip brands.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nKoukash clearly has cash and he wants to be able to spend it. But not every club is in a position to chase success in this way.\nMorley suggests there should be a loophole introduced to have two or three \"star name\" players paid as much as you like outside of the salary cap.\nKoukash added: \"There should be a mechanism in the sport to allow certain scenarios, clubs or situations to go and spend above the cap.\"\nThe man who made his millions from racehorses clearly feels he will be unable to attract rugby league's thoroughbreds to Salford under the current guidelines.\nSuch an argument is unlikely to be met with a huge nod of approval from the likes of Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington who has built his own successful business model on a strict sliding salary scale at the Super League champions.\nThe bigger question of course is that of the sport's profile in World Cup year. McManus says this is rugby league's \"biggest single financial weakness\".\nThis is not a question about allowing Salford to sign as many players as they want. It is about maximising the exposure of the sport to the world and reaping the financial rewards of that.\nMcManus says the game's governing body needs to take responsibility. \"No sponsor is not acceptable. Either from the club's perspective or from that of the governing body,\" he said.\n\"Someone has to be answerable for that. It is something none of us are happy with and someone needs to be accountable.\"\nMcManus feels that if these weaknesses in the way the game is marketed are \"readily identified and dealt with\" then the game has never been in a stronger position to prosper and grow. Koukash will expect to be at the forefront of that.",

		"InputText": "According to Cancer Research UK some 41, 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, but 10,700 will die of the disease, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men.\nGiven such a dire prognosis, and let's face it, given the financial profile of its victims, you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prioritised and well researched areas of oncology. Not a bit of it. Perhaps it's because men are squeamish, or don't like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed \"the Cinderella cancer\".\n\"We just don't make enough of it\" according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. \"On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked\".\nBased at Addenbrooke's Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered.\n\"What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity.  And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour.\"\nBut if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage?\nThat - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological Gene/Environment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In one of the largest research projects of its kind scientists from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London looked at samples from more than 200,000 people - half with, and half without, cancer.\nThe results include 23 new gene variants associated with prostate cancer and 16 with aggressive forms of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer.\n\"It's shocking, but we still don't have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer,\" says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. \"That's because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn't accurate enough and you'd have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years\".\nIf that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery.\nSitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient. And because the robotic arms of the device (which looks a little like a crab hovering over the operating table) are much thinner than the surgeon's, and the grappling and cutting tools at the sharp end are much smaller, what was once a major operation is now less invasive.\nAs with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue is kept to a minimum.\n\"The DaVinci robot has made a huge difference to prostate surgery\" says Prof Neal. \"It's still a major operation, but we can be very precise about what we remove and the function we're able to save. That's got to be good news for the patient\".",

It has shades of the convenient \"lone wolf\" theory about it. Was he the only player to get this stuff? Did he talk to other players about it?\nCoaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand\nHere is my thinking: I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get big. I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get heavier too. The rugby pitch has stayed the same size for 150 years while humans have changed. Rugby is more about going through people than round them now.\nWhat I don't buy is that players are under pressure to buy steroids. It's cheating. The moment you buy the things you are cheating. You know it's not allowed. You are hoping the drug testers never get to you.\nSome players may have contemplated taking steroids but chosen not to do so. If you're not big enough then choose another profession. It's not a game for all shapes and sizes any more.\nCoaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand. Young players go to the gym after taking supplements, they drink supplements during their training, and immediately afterwards.\nPerhaps they are being indoctrinated into thinking that there is no way to do this consuming food alone. Maybe, just maybe, the logical next step from that is that artificial aids help, and the last resort - and illegal - artificial aid is your steroid of choice.\nSo is it possible to get big enough taking food alone?\nThe IRB has its latest drug test figures on its website. It states: \"The IRB carried out 1,542 tests both in and out of competition in 2012, across all IRB tournaments and events, including the HSBC Sevens World Series, Rugby World Cup 2015 qualifiers, men's and women's Tests and Age Grade Rugby.\n\"The programme saw a total of 21 anti-doping rule violation cases, equating to 1.36% of the IRB's entire programme.\"\nThat means around 1.4% of elite level players take drugs and try to get away with it. Some of them, you can see from the website, were caught taking the steroid favoured by both Sam Chalmers and disgraced Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, stanozolol.\nThe 2011 Word Anti-Doping Agency figures, also available on the IRB website, show there were 5,553 drug tests globally in rugby in 2011, and 61 violations within them - just over 1%.\nMy guess is that there are more chancing it lower down the leagues, or in that scramble to get into the system - but I don't know.\nWhen I was in South Africa covering the 1995 Rugby World Cup I wrote then what I repeat now - that the biggest growth in requests at GPs in Capetown nearly 20 years ago was from schoolboys wanting prescriptions for steroids.

Sam Chalmers, son of former player Craig Chalmers, has apologised after admitting to using confirmed steroid, stanozolol, saying he had purchased it online despite being fully aware that it was illegal. Rugby insiders suggest that there is substantial pressure on players to bulk up and get ‘bigger’, although most suggestions are that the drive comes from illegal supplements rather than steroids. The International Rugby Board (IRB) website carries figures stating that 1.4% of elite level players take drugs and try to get away with it.\n"

This is because of a perverse incentive in the system which ministers now want to rectify.\nMeanwhile, travelling to the UK deliberately for health treatment - so-called health tourism - is not allowed.\nThe rules are less clear in other cases, such as expats and asylum seekers.\nThe latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research.\nThe government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the \"most thorough research there has ever been\" in this area.\nThe report itself notes that it is based on \"incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions\", but it says the estimates are the \"best that can be made at present\", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been \"completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know\".\nThe government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue.\nIt has already announced a £200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise £200m a year.\nA cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK.\nMeanwhile, \"deliberate health tourism\" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between £60m and £80m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is \"uncertain\" and the \"plausible range\" of the cost is £20m-£100m.\nFrequent visitors \"taking advantage\" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further £50m-£200m a year, the report adds.\nThe government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the \"conservative\" £500m figure.\nTo achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks.\nFree NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so.\nAsylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment.\nThe UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care.\nThe NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just £73m a year is recouped out of more than £460m at present.\nThis is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care.\nShadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: \"We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment.\"\nBut he added the figures were based on a \"large number of assumptions\" and was more about \"spin than substance\".\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's £500m savings figure was \"exaggerated\", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans.\nHe said migrants paying the proposed £200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to \"get their money's worth\", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than £200.\nDr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments.\nDr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a \"new border agency\" in policing the NHS.\n\"The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments,\" she said.\nJonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been \"hugely overstated\" and was in fact a \"very small part of NHS expenditure\".",

He moved to the Rocket Division of the Ministry of Supply in 1943.\nAfter the war he secured a job with the Daily Express as defence, science and medical editor.\nOne of his best contacts, the chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence in the 1950s, was keen to tell him as much as possible about Britain's atomic weapons programme.\nHe wanted to explain to the public why the country was spending such massive sums of money on it.\n\"I'm up for use any time,\" he said. \"If someone wants to come and tell me some news that nobody else knows and I make a lovely scoop of it, come on, use me!\"\nBut it never worried him that he was being used by senior figures with ideas to promote or scores to settle.\nHis investigative methods were unorthodox. Mainly he bought people agreeable lunches and, over the claret, senior civil servants and politicians would tell him things.\nHis favourite lunch venue was a classy French restaurant called L'Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly, handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster.\nOnly after it closed did he learn that the place had been bugged by MI5 since the 1940s. (It had also, MI5 discovered when removing its own hidden microphones, been bugged by the KGB.)\n\"MI5 heard every conversation that I had and they did nothing about it,\" he said.\n\"All they did was put it in the files. MI5 doesn't like to take any action; they like to know.\n\"'It's in the files: if we take action, they'll know we know.' That's the attitude. It's absolutely crazy.\"\nPincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table but in the countryside.\nIn the 1950s he took up game shooting, and met a good many useful sources while banging away in plus-fours at pheasant and grouse.\nLord Mountbatten, aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff, turned out to be much friendlier when Pincher encountered him shooting.\n\"He invited me to shoot at Broadlands and even dictated a story to me once when I was travelling in his Land Rover, which went straight into the newspaper... but under my name, not his.\"\nIn 1964 he brought into the open the scandal over Ferranti's Â£5 million profit on Bloodhound missiles, which were the major weapon in Britain's air defences.\nThis was a colossal sum at the time and a subsequent inquiry saw the company refunding more than Â£4 million to the Treasury.\nIn 1971, Pincher revealed how the number of staff at the Soviet embassy had increased significantly and claimed that most of the diplomats, chauffeurs and gardeners were really spies.\nThis prompted Edward Heath's government to expel 105 of them, which seriously damaged the Soviet Union's espionage capability.\nAfter his retirement, Pincher's most controversial book was Their Trade is Treachery. This revealed the head of MI5 until 1965, Sir Roger Hollis, had been investigated as a suspected Soviet spy.\nThere was an immense furore, which Pincher doubtless found most gratifying.\nIn the years since, Pincher hardened his line on Hollis, and continued researching the subject becoming convinced that Hollis actually was a Soviet mole.\nNot everyone agrees. Christopher Andrew, MI5's official historian, thinks it's nonsense to suggest Hollis was a traitor.\nRupert Allason, who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West, is more nuanced. \"Some people don't believe there was any hostile penetration of the security service.\n\"Personally I've seen the evidence: I know there was penetration up until at least September 1963.\n\"Where I part company with Harry is on the issue of candidates. He believes it was Sir Roger Hollis, I'm not convinced of that; but I am persuaded there was a mole.\"\nOne of the main sources for Pincher's book was the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, whose book Spycatcher was the subject of a long court case to try to prevent publication.\nMargaret Thatcher's government was infuriated by Their Trade is Treachery; but then angering prime ministers was nothing new to Pincher.\nIn May 1959, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote a personal minute, marked \"secret\", to his minister of defence.\n\"I do not understand,\" he wrote, \"how the Express alone of all the newspapers has got the exact decision that we reached at the cabinet last Thursday on space. Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Mr Chapman Pincher?\n\"I am getting very concerned about how well informed he always seems to be on defence matters.\"\nAnd the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson contributed to what may have been Pincher's finest moment in 1967.\nWhat became known as \"the D notice affair\" began with a \"walk-in\", a member of the public who turns up at a newspaper's front door with a possible scoop.\nThe information given to Pincher was that all private cables and Post Office telegrams were being intercepted and that some were being read by GCHQ.\nBefore publishing the story, Pincher checked with a contact called Lt Col Sammy Lohan, secretary of the D notice committee.\nThe D notice system is a voluntary one, designed to alert the news media to stories that might damage national security if published.\nLohan told Pincher his story was not covered by any D notices, and the Express went ahead and printed the scoop.\nWilson was furious and set up an inquiry to show that D notices had in fact been breached. The inquiry concluded the exact opposite, and vindicated the Express.\nIn his Who's Who entry, Pincher listed ferreting in Whitehall and bolting politicians as two of his recreations.\nHe said he didn't regret a single thing he had found out and printed.\n\"I always tried to meet all the top people because that's where the stories lay,\" he said.\n\"When you have access to people you have access to facts, usually secret facts.\"",

After winning possession, Naismith ran into the area to receive a Baines pass before stabbing a shot at goal. Rodriguez tried to clear, but the ball cannoned off goalkeeper Diego Benaglio, and hit the Wolfsburg full-back again before ending up in his own net.\nThat was Everton's first goal in Europe at Goodison Park since beating Sporting Lisbon 2-1 in February 2010, and it had the buoyant home crowd hungry for more.\nEverton duly attempted to deliver, with full-backs Baines and Coleman becoming more adventurous as Wolfsburg offered little going forward, and their attacking instincts resulted in the home side's second goal on the stroke of half-time.\nMirallas's drive was weakly pushed into the path of Baines, who had followed the shot into the area, and he knocked the ball across goal for Coleman to nod in.\nWolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking introduced Germany midfielder Aaron Hunt for the start of the second half, but within seconds of the restart Everton went further ahead. This time, Robin Knoche's foul on McGeady was deemed to have occurred inside the area, and Baines confidently despatched the resulting penalty.\nThe goal effectively ended Wolfsburg's hopes of returning to Germany with anything to show but, with nothing to lose, they embarked on a spell of dominance.\nFor a good 30 minutes they enjoyed the lion's share of possession and attempts on goal, as Tim Howard produced saves from Luiz Gustavo's opportunistic shot and Rodriguez's well-struck free-kick.\nFormer Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner was introduced after the hour, with Wolfsburg boss Hecking sensing a possible goal, but instead it was Everton who grabbed a fourth. Mirallas peeled away from defenders to run on to substitute Samuel Eto'o's through ball and he coolly slotted in at Benaglio's near post.\nThere was still time for Wolfsburg to get the consolation their 27 shots on goal deserved, Rodriguez making some amends for his early own goal with a curling free-kick.\nEverton boss Roberto Martinez: \"The atmosphere was perfect for us to start a very good performance.\n\"I thought there were two very good sides. On the night the scoreline probably doesn't reflect the difference between the two sides.\n\"We scored at the right times. Our work-rate was magnificent. We had to defend and we did that really well but every time we went forward we had a clinical touch about us.\"\nWolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking: \"It's obviously not the start we'd hoped for. We were lacking in certain areas, both in terms of finishing and defensive work.\n\"We should have gone into half-time a goal down and we got hit with a second just before the break.

		"InputText": "While $50m is the starting point for serious wealth, \"in reality your spending power and investing power really gets to the next level when you get to around $100m\", says Catherine Tillotson.\nMs Tillotson is joint managing partner of Scorpio Partnership, a London-based firm which advises the super-rich on how to manage their assets, and she says there is a reason for this dividing line between the wealthy elite and the rest of us.\n\"This is the point at which families will start to think about employing people purely to help them manage their financial affairs,\" she says.\nThere may now be more multi-millionaires and billionaires than ever before in the world, but since the 2008 global financial crisis the wealth gap between the world's top 1% and the rest of us has grown.\nThis increasingly stark division between haves and have-nots is leading to increasing rancour towards the very wealthy, say many social commentators.\nRobert Kuhn is better placed than many to understand this hostility - a former investment banker and corporate strategist, he is himself among the world's wealthy elite.\nThe world is getting wealthier - we live longer, eat better, are better educated and fewer people live in extreme poverty.\nBut with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, the BBC is investigating the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015.\nA Richer World 2015\n\"I think much of it is justified,\" he says, perhaps surprisingly, \"and I think we should describe why that's the case.\"\nOne of the main reasons for this, he says, is the web. \"We have a very highly wired world with the internet, people are more aware of things - and I think that's a good thing.\"\nMr Kuhn is coy about his own net worth. When asked if it is \"tens of millions\" of dollars, he replies, \"I would not like to be too specific, but I wouldn't contradict what you just said.\"\nTrained as a neuroscientist, Mr Kuhn became an investment banker and then in the early 1990s sold his mergers and acquisitions firm \"at the right time\".\nHe says he worked hard, \"but if I don't acknowledge there was a lot of luck involved I would be fooling myself\".\nHe wants to encourage more and more people to become wealthy, but also to place limits on the amount of wealth that can be passed on to the next generation.\n\"That gives each generation a chance to have higher social mobility.\"\nBut given that the gap between rich and poor has reached its widest level for 30 years in most developed countries, according to says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) group of developed nations - that social mobility is getting harder for many.\nIn the 1980s, the richest 10% had incomes seven times greater than the poorest 10% in the average industrialised country.\nNow, in those same countries, the richest have incomes nine-and-a half times greater than the poorest, on average. The actual figures vary widely across the 34 OECD's member states.\nIn Denmark the top 10% earn about five times more than the bottom 10% - in Mexico they earn 30 times as much.\nHow much more do the top 10% earn than the bottom 10%?\nSource: OECD (2011)\nOther organisations, too, are highlighting this discrepancy between rich and poor. A report this month from the charity Oxfam says the world's wealthiest 1% will own more than 50% of the world's wealth by 2016.\n\"This is something that we should be very worried about,\" says Mark Pearson, the OECD's deputy director of employment, labour and social affairs.\nIf countries want to boost their economic growth, then they need to take steps to narrow this wealth gap, says the OECD.\nThis goes against the longstanding free market argument that rising wealth at the top will trickle down to everybody else.\nBut, the OECD research suggest that the reverse is true. \"Our finding is that by reducing income inequality, you can boost economic growth,\" Mr Pearson told BBC World Service's Business Daily programme.\nAn increasing wealth gap hinders economic growth because it limits investment in a country's labour force, argues the OECD.\nPoorer people cannot afford to spend as much as the rich can on their children's education.\nAnd that lack of investment in education means a less educated and less flexible workforce in the long run, says the group in its research.\nIt is not just the super-rich that are doing well - those whose business is dealing with super-rich customers are profiting too.\nAlex Cheatle is chief executive of Ten Group, a lifestyle concierge service that can helps its clients get that exclusive restaurant table, sell-out theatre ticket - or finds that vintage sports car in a particular colour.\nTen will even do your window-shopping for you, if you are too rich or famous to be able to do it yourself.\n\"Very often they will want us to take a picture of the window and get it to them, so they do their window shopping as and when they want to,\" says Mr Cheatle.\n\"There hasn't really been a crisis for many of our members. Business is booming for us, we've grown every year since 2008 - growing at an average rate of 25-30% a year.\"\nWhen you consider how much the super-rich spend, that growth is perhaps not surprising.\nOver the course of a year, it's reckoned the world's top 1% spend a staggering $45bn (£30bn) on travel and hospitality, $40bn (£26bn) on cars, and $25bn (£16bn) each on art, jewellery and watches.\nOr course, the ultimate statement of wealth is to have your own super-yacht - complete with helicopter pad, speedboat tenders and even a submarine or two.\nThe world's biggest such boat is currently the Azzam, 180m (590ft) long, launched in 2013 at a reported cost of up to $600m (£400m) - and the sector has certainly weathered the global slowdown better than many others.\nSource: Boat International\nSo with the wealth gap rising should the rich pay more tax, and if so would that help?\nRobert Kuhn - now business and financial commentator - argues that countries that decide to increase taxes on the rich may not see any benefit.\nHe believes increasing income taxes to too high a level would \"inhibit the creation of new wealth which is detrimental to society\".\n\"I'm just worried about the behaviour and implications if you put too high a tax rate, what that will do to current generations in their energy and focus to create new wealth,\" says Mr Kuhn.\nAt Scipio Partnership, Catherine Tillotson says that focussing on tax misses out the contributions made by many rich patrons to philanthropic and charitable causes.\n\"The tax question is hugely complicated,\" she says.\n\"Most families that I've met will say that it is absolutely critical to them that they pay the right amount of tax according to the rules.\"\nHowever, \"in many ways those dollars spent on philanthropic passions may be doing more good than they would have done in the tax system\", she says.\nYet ever since the financial crisis of 2008, and subsequent global economic slowdown, politicians have come under increasing pressure to increase tax contributions from the richest in their societies.\nProtest movements such as Occupy Wall Street, which started in 2011 and has since spread to many other countries, have highlighted concern over social and economic inequality worldwide.\nFor his part, Robert Kuhn is not convinced that a widening wealth gap matters in economic terms, but \"it matters in social stability for sure\", he agrees.\n\"It matters in terms of social mobility of subsequent generations.\"\n\"To me that's the biggest problem, for any country,\" he says. \"And many countries are facing that.\"\nClick here for more from BBC's A Richer World, a season exploring the world's wealth, poverty and inequality",

Cate Blanchett plays the stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter is the fairy godmother.\n\"Keeping it classic is the twist,\" says Branagh, who started his directing career in 1989 with his adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V.\n\"I always felt that it's better to do a modern version of a story using the historical perspective, than say, make a story of Cinderella in Brooklyn in 2015.\n\"I find that when you try and update Shakespeare to a contemporary setting too, you always pay a price.\n\"In this case, the original material of Cinderella is far richer than my ideas, so it seems to me that it's my job to make it simple. Just let the fairytale speak, because it affects us in a more complicated way than we think.\n\"Audiences have already come up to me saying the film is about patchwork families, about child bereavement, about the politics between women these days. Fairytales are a psychological brain-worm that need to be left alone to do their work.\"\nHelena Bonham Carter says that at first she was dubious \"as to whether a straight version would work\".\n\"I think it's a really good film, but it could so easily have been bad. I was saying: 'So you're really going to do a completely straight version of Cinderella? No gimmicks, no extra frills, no 3D?'\n\"It's very classic, but they know me, and they allowed me not to be that straight in my own role.\"\nJust as audiences seem to have taken to the film, critics such as the Guardian's Guy Lodge comment that \"while it might have been nice to see the new-model Cinderella follow Frozen's progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film's naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm\".\nBut James disagrees that this Cinderella is an old-fashioned heroine, pointing out that at the start of Disney's 1950 classic, Cinderella \"is staring out of the window dreaming of the prince and waiting for him to rescue her\".\n\"This Cinderella doesn't do that at all. I think we make it very clear that everything she does is her choice - even deciding to stay on at her parents' house with such wicked treatment from her stepmother.\n\"She is told by her dying mother to 'have courage and be kind' and this is the film's, and Cinderella's, backbone.\"\nThis is the first major leading role for Surrey-born James. \"Not even a big TV series like Downton could prepare me for this fuss,\" she says.\n\"I am getting slightly carried away. I keep seeing giant posters of me all over the place in a big blue dress and people shouting my name.\n\"I'm trying to enjoy the magic actually - this is the fairytale aspect of it for me, personally. It's quite something that so many little girls are going to think I'm Cinderella.\"\nJames has dismissed speculation that her waist had been digitally altered to make it smaller as \"irrelevant\", claiming that fans were interested in Cinderella because of her \"morals\".\nCate Blanchett agrees that the core of the film is \"kindness\", adding that it is \"an unusual quality these days. There's not a cynical bone in this film's body and that's its strength.\n\"There is cruelty and jealousy in the movie too, but too often we don't value kindness. In today's world you think someone who is kind is a doormat, and the fact this triumphs is really heart-warming.\"\nBranagh, who previously directed Marvel's Thor, describes kindness \"as its own super-power. It is a dark world and children do need to understand they need courage and resilience to get through it.\n\"People often compare the story of Shakespeare's King Lear in relation to Cinderella. There is a resemblance there - a father making a tragic error and three daughters; great cruelty and great kindness.\n\"This film is all about the difficult but simple choice to be good and kind. Whether you're dealing with Shakespeare or the great fairy stories, they are all great big metaphors for human nature.\n\"And regardless of what happens to this film version, I believe this is why the tale of Cinderella will keep enduring.\"\nCinderella is out in the UK on 27 March.",

At such a time, one has to look at the strategy, at refinements that need to be made, at efforts that need to be augmented, and I know that's what's going on right now.\"\n1974: Graduates from West Point US military academy, joining the army\n2007: Leads US troop surge during Iraq conflict\n2008: Head of US Central Command\n2010: Nato commander in Afghanistan\nMid-2011: Leaves military to become CIA director\nNovember 2012: Resigns over affair\nAfter commanding international troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gen Petraeus became head of the CIA but was forced to stand down in 2012, following revelations of an extra-marital affair.\nSubsequent allegations that he provided classified information to his mistress while he was CIA director led him to plead guilty to one misdemeanour charge.\nBut despite the turbulence of his private life, Gen Petraeus remains one of the heroes of America's controversial military operations of recent years.\nHe was the architect of the \"surge\" in Iraq that deployed more US troops, but equally important, got them out of their defended compounds to create security at a local level.\nHe also greatly expanded the Anbar Awakening, the mobilisation of Sunni tribesmen to combat al-Qaeda.\nNot surprisingly in the wake of the recent setbacks in Iraq, his views are being canvassed by the White House, the Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill.\nThe keynote of the Petraeus approach today is as it always was - the need for the political and military aspects of strategy to march closely in step.\n\"You cannot deal with an industrial-strength extremist problem just with force of arms,\" he said.  \"You have to have that political component as well.\"\nPolitical change has to start at the top. Above all, Gen Petraeus says, \"the Sunni Arabs have to be given incentives to support the new Iraq rather than to oppose it\".\nAs to the fundamental question - can the Iraqi military actually win against Islamic State? - he has few doubts.\n\"During the surge and in the years after the surge, Iraqi forces fought and died for their country at vastly higher numbers than did US and coalition forces. We know that they can fight,\" he insists.\n\"We know that they will fight. But they will only fight if they have good leadership, and the support and knowledge that somebody will have their back if they get into a tough fight.\"\nThat looks like requiring greater US involvement closer to the frontline. Gen Petraeus is reluctant to give details.\n\"Should there be US advisors with Iraqi forces below the divisional  level?\" he asks. \"Should there be joint teams of tactical air controllers on the ground with security and other assets to support them?\n\"Does there need to be an augmentation of the train-and-equip effort? Can we accelerate the delivery of some of the equipment that Iraq so desperately needs?\"\nIt sounds like the elements of a blueprint for a re-invigorated US effort. But then again - typical Petraeus - there is the political dimension.\n\"Are we doing all that we can to empower and support those Iraqi leaders, starting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who recognise the need to bring the Sunni Arab population back into the fabric of Iraqi society? And, most importantly, are our military elements and structures sufficiently supporting the political component and vice versa?\"\nIn response to my comment that all this could have been said a year ago - Gen Petraeus responded by saying that he did indeed say it all a year ago. This is not about re-inventing the wheel.\n\"We need to see the same elements of this (previous) comprehensive civil-military counter- insurgency campaign, albeit today with the Iraqis playing the key roles, enabled by the Americans.\"\nGen Petraeus acknowledges the difficulties of grappling with the horrors in Syria but insists that the only way forward is to train and equip moderate opposition elements. He says that more such fighters will spring up once the programme gets under way.\nAnd he is very cautious about any Iranian role in combating IS. He insists Iran remains a revolutionary power in the region.\n\"This is a country that has made progress because of chaos. It has both benefited from chaos and fomented chaos to try to achieve regional hegemony,\" he says.\nSo he believes that \"while there can indeed be some coincidence of interest between the US, its coalition allies in the region and Iran in terms of the defeat of IS (...) the over-arching context is one that gives you reason to have considerable caution in how you go forward in the relationship with Iran\".\nGen Petraeus still travels to Iraq regularly. He knows the key players well. And though out of uniform and established in a civilian career as an adviser, he remains the man who did achieve a kind of success in Iraq.\nThat is a commodity that is in short supply today for the Americans and the Iraqi authorities. This  makes the Petraeus approach an attractive model.\nBut the question remains: Can the outcome be the same with the Iraqi military cast in the role of the Americans?",

But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (Â£13,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease.\n\"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\"\nThree years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club.\nMr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers.\nAnd he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space.\nMr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient.\n\"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\"\nMr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US.\nAn industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020.\n\"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\"\nWhile the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age.\n\"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says.\n\"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\"\nMr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news.\n\"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,\" he says. \"There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\"\nBut clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person.\n\"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield.\n\"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge.\n\"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics.\nThe middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\"\nTop-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year.\nSteve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons.\nHe describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring.\nAnd although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income.\nMr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at.\n\"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500.\n\"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\"\nMr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks.\n\"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh?\n\"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\"\nWhile the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost.\n\"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says.\n\"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it.\n\"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\"\nBut in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh.\nBack in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September.\nHe says: \"We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'.\n\"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet.\n\"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof.\"",

Kaino was sin-binned for kicking the ball away and Pollard stroked over his fourth penalty to make it 12-7 at the interval, the green-shirted supporters in the capacity crowd starting to believe that the upset was on.\nThe Springboks had not lost to the All Blacks in 21 Tests when leading or level at half-time, but despite being a man down New Zealand closed the gap to two points as a spell of carefully worked territory was capped with a Carter drop-goal.\nSchalk Burger then lost the ball metres from his own line, the All Blacks went right and drove on through their forwards before Ma'a Nonu sent replacement Barrett diving into the corner.\nWith Habana sin-binned for knocking the ball from scrum-half Aaron Smith's hands and Carter bending over the conversion for 17-12, the match appeared to have turned.\nPollard and Carter exchanged penalties, and with replacements pouring on to the pitch and the rain hammering down the two heavyweights went toe to toe.\nPat Lambie came on for Pollard to make it 20-18 with 10 minutes to go, and an air of desperation was apparent in both sides.\nCarter sprinted half the length of the pitch to clear from De Allende, South Africa failed to capitalise from an attacking line-out and New Zealand escaped into opposition territory as the seconds crawled by, running the clock down with a series of drives to celebrate with exhaustion at the end.\nBen Smith was faultless under the high ball and Dan Carter's decision-making once again peerless.\nHowever, for his muscular, repeated carrying in a relentlessly physical match and the superb run and timing of pass for Beauden Barrettt's critical second-half try, Ma'a Nonu deserves the honour.\nNew Zealand coach Steve Hansen: \"It was always going to be close, they're a great side and they showed that again.

Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.\n\"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\"\nEvans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock\".\n\"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\"\nBBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age\".\n\"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said.\n\"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.\n\"But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.\"\nPrime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a \"wonderful human being\".\n\"I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour,\" he said.\nVeteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was \"stunned\" at the news and that his condolences were \"very much with Helen and the family\".\nSir Terry died surrounded by his family \"after a short but brave battle with cancer\", a statement released by his family said.\nHe leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.\nAn online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.\nThe city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.\n\"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\"\nPresident of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country.\nFamily friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\".\nThe Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.\n\"I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money.\n\"For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan,\" he added.\nSir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.\nBlessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.\nHe also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.\nFrom 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.\nThe second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\".\nTributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.\nBBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.

But these new attacks are the most significant yet - rebel forces are attacking key front lines, and there have been repeated air strikes by the Syrian military.\nThis upsurge in fighting is putting new pressure on fragile peace talks. Opposition delegates are now discussing if the time has come to leave Geneva - they are reported to have received a letter from rebel forces on the ground, urging them to exert more pressure on the UN envoy Staffan de Mistura who has been mediating in these indirect negotiations between the warring sides.\nThe opposition is now accusing the UN of bias after Mr de Mistura floated a proposal to allow Syria's President Assad  to remain in office, in a ceremonial role.\nI've heard that idea in recent months from Russian and Iranian sources. But Syrian opposition groups have flatly rejected it - their Western backers are urging them not to walk out but it is becoming increasingly clear that these talks are not going anywhere.\nThe HNC wanted to express its disappointment at the deterioration in the humanitarian situation and in the cessation of hostilities, Mr de Mistura said.\nBut the envoy added that the HNC would remain in Geneva and informal discussions with the two sides would continue with a view to \"taking stock\" on Friday.\nThe US on Monday called on Russia to use its influence on the Syrian government to stop attacks that threatened the seven-week cessation of hostilities as well as the Geneva peace talks, a State Department official said.\nSeparately, President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held an \"intense conversation\" on Monday that covered Syria, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.\nMeanwhile, four Syrians including three children in the Turkish town of Kilis were killed in rocket fire from Syrian territory controlled by co-called Islamic State (IS), the local governor's office said.\nThe Turkish military fired artillery in response, Hurriyet newspaper reported.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that rebels had launched an assault on the positions of government forces and their allies in Latakia's northern countryside early on Monday and by midday had made advances.\nThe UK-based monitoring group also said rebels were close to taking over the town of Khirbat al-Naqus, in the strategically important Sahl al-Ghab plain in the north-west of Hama province.\nA Syrian military source confirmed the attacks, according to the Reuters news agency.\nLatakia is the heartland of President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect, and the Sahl al-Ghab lies just to the east of the coastal mountains where Mr Assad's ancestral village of Qardaha is located.\nMeanwhile, the Syrian Observatory said four people were killed in heavy government air strikes in northern Homs province.\nTwenty-two civilians were killed over the weekend in Aleppo, with at least 16 dying as a result of rebel shell- and sniper-fire and the six others dying in government air strikes, according to the group.\nMilitants from the group known as Islamic State (IS), which along with the rival jihadist group al-Nusra Front is excluded from the cessation of hostilities, have meanwhile seized more territory from rebel groups near the Turkish border north of Aleppo, forcing some 35,000 civilians to flee towards the opposition-held town of Azaz.\nMedecins Sans Frontieres warned on Monday that the situation was now critical for more than 100,000 displaced people trapped around Azaz, with active fighting just 7km (four miles) away and the border closed for all but the most seriously ill Syrians.",

As we have previously noted, the cessation of hostilities agreed by Russia and the US to facilitate peace talks had proved to be holding apart from attacks by ISIS and al-Qaeda. The talks had struggled to move forward. This news has come as UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, told the BBC that the idea of President Bashar al-Assad’s remaining in a ceremonial role had been floated, however, opposition groups had rejected the proposal and had accused the UN of bias. Meanwhile, both the US and Russia have called for peace talks to continue.\n"

		"InputText": "\"There's a lot going on right now,\"  the singer tells us. And she's not wrong.\nThe follow-up to her Mercury Prize-nominated debut, 2013's Sing To The Moon, is imminent. Second album The Dreaming Room is due in June and her newest track Phenomenal Woman has just debuted as Annie Mac's hottest record on BBC Radio 1.\n\"And then we have probably the most important live moment on TV in this country today,\" she adds.\n\"It's all potentially extremely exciting - and that just means that I'm naturally terrified.\"\nThe singer's struggles with stage fright and anxiety are well-documented and live TV is a particular fear.\nDescribing the concept as \"just hellish\", she tells us: \"I'd rather die. That's how I feel sometimes - I think, 'if I dropped dead I wouldn't have to do it!'.\"\nSo, it's perhaps surprising that the singer let us tag along as she kicked off the new series of Later... with Jools Holland. But it seems BBC Two's esteemed music show has a special place in her heart.\n\"In the musician's world, you say 'Jools Holland' and all of a sudden you've got massive respect - it's like saying you got Glastonbury.\"\nHer third time on Later... she calls respected musician and presenter Holland a \"genuine champion\".\n\"He called me this afternoon just to say that he'd been listening to my new record and he wanted to tell me specifically what song and what parts and why.\n\"I tell you, in the TV world, it's not the kind of place where there's room for those kind of genuine interactions, just because there's so much pressure on everyone. It's very special.\"\nHere the diary of Laura's day.\nTour manager Paul picks us up in sunny east London. Laura's assistant Mariama is laden with popcorn and snacks as we pile into the silver Mercedes van bound for the studios in Kent. The singer takes some me-time behind her shades, safe in the knowledge it's going to be a long day.\n\"I'm such a weird person to be around before anything big,\" she admits.\n\"I can't normally talk, so my team tend to just leave me to it, but I'll pick up.\n\"Right now I want to be jumping up, but you don't want to celebrate before the main event, so I'm just trying to be as relaxed as I can.\"\nWe arrive to the sounds of Kano and his brass section sound-checking. He's on the bill along with Paul Simon, The Coral, Jason Isbell and Lake Street Dive.\nLaura has the honour of opening and closing both the live and pre-recorded shows, something she says she's \"glad you only find out on the day\".\n\"I'm doing Phenomenal Woman, Kiss My Feet - which the Jools team requested - and Overcome, the first single, which featured Nile Rogers.\n\"I wanted to explode back onto the scene with something that was captivating in a much rawer and darker way. That's why there's dance and so much movement this time around, and why it's such a visual album.\"\nBackstage the band are split across two dressing rooms - one for the boys and one for the girls, where we're quickly made welcome as they debate which of the many black items of clothing they've brought will get worn.\n\"There's nine of us - it's huge by pop terms, but I refused to compromise,\" says Laura.\n\"With Sing To The Moon, six of us were trying to sound like an orchestra and a choir. It was a stress.\n\"My sister Dionne went from violin to guitar - literally learnt the guitar [and] is killing it - my brother's playing cello. It feels much more like a band than me trying to do the solo artist thing. We feel like a really solid family.\"\nStill in her fur-lined boots and denim dress from the journey, Laura and the band head to the camera rehearsal. Jools arrives and gives Laura a hug, waving hello to the production team. Giant white cue cards are being written to help him introduce the acts.\nRunning through each of their tracks twice, Laura sports her new keytar in place of her trademark piano.\n\"Lady Mariama was up until 4am trying to make my keytar white. I mean what the hell is that about?\" she laughs.\n\"Initially it was a joke idea, I was just messing about jamming with it, but it made so much sense. I'm not stuck behind anything in a static way anymore, I can move and I can see people. If I want to turn and feel the band I can do that. We have such a good time now.\"\nTime for some nourishment. The team (\"there's like millions of them... making it work\") are handed pocket money for the canteen, while Laura retreats to her dressing room. As well as make-up, wardrobe and calming those nerves, she also has a TV interview to fit in.\n\"I used to not eat, I couldn't eat. But I've learned to, so you don't drop off after one song. I have meatballs and sweet potato fries. And a balance of water and red wine.\"\n\"[Designer] Alex Noble has done a lot of my clothes recently,\" says Laura. \"He is just on another planet. He text me yesterday and I was just weeping emojis because the clothes are just... I mean you'll see with the outfit tonight.\n\"I made a visual essay for the album, this massive book [filled with] images, as stimulus for new music but also to help anybody I might be collaborating with. Stylists or people in the label, anyone could take the book and go 'oh yeah, I'm listening and I'm looking'.\n\"It means I get to talk less. That's probably surprising to some people because I do love to natter! But it helps.\"\nMinutes before show time, Laura's designer and assistant are still huddled together in one of the dressing rooms with a needle and thread and the singer's fabulous outfit in their hands.\nShe's set to do an interview at Jools's famous piano, but the purple corset she'll be wearing (with matching super-flared trousers) will be too tight to sit down in. Cue furious unpicking and re-stitching. Eventually it's decided she'll do the interview standing up. Problem solved.\nWith the audience in place and schooled on how to cheer and clap in the correct manner, Laura's up first - opening the pre-recorded show with Maya Angelou-inspired anthem Phenomenal Woman.\n\"If you're first out of the blocks - you're the thing in the room that makes the first sound. I've been second and third before and everybody breathes when the sound's been made,\" says Laura.\nThere's mild panic when the lighting desk freezes after The Coral perform, but after a few minutes of confusion they're rolling again.\nLater, a respectful hush descends as Paul Simon performs Sounds Of Silence in the centre of the studio.\n\"He made me cry so much,\" says Laura. \"I kept thinking, 'why didn't I bring Mum to this gig?'. She was raised on Simon and Garfunkel.\n\"I ended up thinking about my whole life, my creative life... what is this all about? Here I am literally stood in front of Mr Paul Simon.\"\nWith all the stars limbered up (and the shortest of toilet breaks), the second show goes live on BBC Two.\n\"It's an amazing feeling because you know that it's happening now and everybody's tuned in, but at the same time - the fear and the dread. You can't correct anything, so whatever comes out is it. \"\nLaura ends the live show on a high with Phenomenal Woman.\n\"That for me was surprisingly wonderful, because live television literally - there's nothing that I'm more terrified of! And the live performance was better than the pre-record - what?!\"\nIt's all over. The audience files out and the set's dismantled as artists and their teams pack up their gear and rush to congratulate each other.\nUS outfit Lake Street Dive collar Laura for a picture, while she and sister Dionne seek out Kano for a snap (\"Because he's fine. And obviously amazing\").\n\"I always forget how emotionally exhausting it is,\" says Laura.\n\"The amount I invest into any performance is always bucket loads of sweat or tension that doesn't get released until I'm in that moment.\n\"That's the uniqueness of a show like Jools's - you are getting that concentrated performance.\"\nSo what now?\n\"Everybody laughs at me because I literally make a beeline for my bed after. I'll probably eat again later because I always get a major appetite, which is why I have this thing [grabs belly area] that will never go away.\n\"But yeah, I just conk out. If I think about stuff I'll go nuts, because you've just put something out.\n\"I mean I haven't had a child, but I imagine - like when you have a baby - it's out there. I can't push it back in!\"\nYou can catch the extended edition of Later... with Jools Holland on BBC Two on Friday 22 April at 23:15 BST or watch Tuesday night's live episode on the iPlayer now.",

Spain are hoping to retain the title they won in 2008 and 2012.\nEngland will be appearing at their ninth finals, while Wales and Northern Ireland have qualified for the first time.\nGood question - because, for the first time, there are 24 teams competing in the finals. That is an increase from the 16 that had taken part in every edition since it was hosted in England in 1996.\nWith six groups of four teams, it means the top two will qualify for the last 16, plus the four best third-placed finishers. In other words, only eight teams will fail to qualify from the group stage.\nOne point could be enough to put your team into the last 16 - and from then the tournament goes to a knockout format.\nAs Greece proved by pulling off a sensational triumph at Euro 2004, trying to predict a winner is a difficult game.\nWorld champions Germany are understandably one of the favourites, while holders Spain are also short odds with the bookmakers.\nGermany finished top of their qualification group but booking their place in France was not without its hiccups - with defeats by Poland and the Republic of Ireland. They have been beaten by France and England since qualifying but remain one to watch.\nSpain dominated international football between 2008 and 2012 but failed to qualify from their group at the 2014 World Cup. Could this be a last hurrah for Vicente del Bosque's ageing but brilliant side?\nFrance won the World Cup as hosts in 1998 - can they repeat the famous success of the team led by Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane and Laurent Blanc?\nA run into the latter stages by Les Bleus is likely to help restore national morale in a country still recovering from last year's deadly Paris attacks.\nFrance are the bookmakers' favourites to win the whole thing, but their form is tricky to gauge because they did not have to qualify for this tournament.\nFast on the counter and unified after years of internal division, watch out for talented midfielders Paul Pogba and Blaise Matuidi.\nBut they cannot call upon prolific Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema. The French Football Federation (FFF) said he would not be picked after being investigated for his part in an alleged plot to blackmail Les Bleus team-mate Mathieu Valbuena, who did not make the squad.\nWell, there are three of them in France - only Scotland missed out - plus the Republic of Ireland. It is going to get crowded too, because England and Wales are both in Group B, along with Russia and debutants Slovakia.\nDon't expect much work to get done when England and Wales play each other - that match in Lens will be shown live on BBC One, kick-off 14:00 BST, on Thursday, 16 June.\nRoy Hodgson's England have a good young team but doubts persist about their defence. They breezed through their qualifying group with a perfect record of 10 wins, while confidence was further boosted with March's impressive win away at world champions Germany.\nWales have got Real Madrid star Gareth Bale and plenty of heart. Chris Coleman's side reached their first major tournament in 57 years after losing just once in qualification.\nNorthern Ireland might have numerous players from England's lower leagues but they finished top of their qualifying group, losing just one of their 10 matches.\nStriker Kyle Lafferty could not get a game for club side Norwich during qualifying (he has since been loaned to Birmingham) but he scored seven crucial goals in nine games for his country.\nWith the 24-team format offering hope to traditionally less-successful nations, five countries have taken advantage to secure their European Championship finals debut.\nNorthern Ireland and Wales, of course, are two of them.\nSlovakia, who have been drawn alongside England and Wales in Group B, have qualified for the first time as an independent state. A 1-0 win against Spain showed the 2010 World Cup qualifiers can mix it with Europe's elite. Beware England and Wales.\nAlbania have never been near a major finals, but edged out Denmark - the 1992 champions - in their qualifying group thanks to a shock win in Portugal. Oh, and because they were awarded a 3-0 win in Serbia by the Court of Arbitration for Sport after a riot.\nWith a population of roughly 330,000 (comparable to Coventry) and only 21,508 registered players, Iceland are unsurprisingly the smallest nation to ever qualify for the finals.\nHow did they do that? By beating the Netherlands - 1988 winners and three-time semi-finalists - home and away during qualifying. The Dutch, for the first time since 1984, will not be there.\nReal Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who was voted the world's second best player behind Argentina's Lionel Messi in the 2015 Ballon d'Or vote, heads a star-studded cast.\nRonaldo will be leading Portugal's challenge, while Wales hope his club-mate Gareth Bale - the world's most expensive player - can transform his impressive La Liga form onto the international stage.\nWorld Cup winners Germany boast a host of stellar names who have impressed in previous tournaments, most notably Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and forward Thomas Muller plus Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos.\nFrance's challenge is set to be driven by energetic Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, who is still reportedly courting the attention of several English Premier League sides.\nBelgium are not short of star quality either. Premier League pair Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne will spearhead their quest for a first major tournament win, but the Red Devils are without injured captain Vincent Kompany.\nAnd Sweden superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 34, will be hoping to illuminate an international tournament for what could be the final time.\nThe Netherlands' failure to qualify leaves Bayern Munich winger Arjen Robben watching from home, while his club-mate Franck Ribery was not named in the France squad, despite suggestions he was considering ending his international retirement.\nThe tournament's 51 games will be staged at 10 locations across France, including new stadiums in Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon and Nice.\nThe opening match - between France and Romania on 10 June - and the 10 July final will be played at the Stade de France in Paris.\nBuilding the new venues and renovating historic grounds such as Marseille's Stade Velodrome has cost 1.6bn euros (£1.2bn) - modernisation which was necessary, organisers say, because France did not fully capitalise on hosting the 1998 World Cup.\nVibrating stands, floating roofs and adjacent slag heaps - read BBC Sport's venue-by-venue guide\nIn March this year, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) ratified a host of revisions to the laws of the game in an attempt to remove inconsistencies and meet the needs of the modern game. The changes came into effect on 1 June, so will apply for Euro 2016.\nMore than 90 revisions were made, but these are some of the key changes:\nKick-off: Previously, the ball had to go forward from kick-off but the rule has been changed to allow it to go in any direction.\nPre-match red cards: Players can now be sent off before a match gets under way, although they can be replaced by another player in the match-day squad.\nLeaving the pitch after treatment: If a player is injured in a challenge resulting in a yellow or red card, they no longer have to leave the field and can have a quick assessment or medical treatment. This change is designed to prevent situations where a team would be temporarily down to 10 players.\nThe end of 'triple punishment': A professional foul inside the area will now normally result in a yellow card for the offender, and not a red. This is to end the so-called triple punishment of penalty, dismissal and suspension, which was seen by some as excessive. There are exceptions for when the offender will receive a red which include holding, pushing or pulling and violent conduct.\nGoalline technology, already established in the Premier League and elsewhere, will be used at Euro 2016.\nYes. But you had better be quick. Most of the group games - including all of England's matches - are sold out.\nHowever, as of 9 June there are tickets available to watch Wales and Northern Ireland, plus other games involving some of the smaller nations. There are also tickets available for the opening game between France and Romania - at 395 euros each.\nFind the latest ticket details on Uefa's official Euro 2016 website\nEach of the 10 host cities will have official Uefa fan zones. The fan zones will have a giant screen for showing all of the matches throughout the tournament.\nThe biggest will be in Paris, where up to 90,000 supporters can gather on the Champ de Mars - in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower.\nYou won't miss a kick.\nThe BBC and ITV will bring audiences closer to the heart of the action than ever before with extensive coverage of Euro 2016.\nThe BBC will showcase 26 live matches on TV and streamed online within its 140 hours of programming, including highlights on BBC One, BBC Two and the Red Button plus 24 days of coverage on Radio 5 live.\nThe BBC's Euro 2016 digital service will feature live broadcasts of all BBC games, commentary and live text coverage of every game featuring in-game highlight clips, on-demand highlights of every goal, breaking news, exclusive features and expert analysis.\nITV will be home to 26 live games across ITV1 and ITV4, which will be simulcast live on the ITV Hub.\nREAD MORE: Ferdinand and Henry join BBC coverage for the Euros\nThe French government has extended a state of emergency imposed after the Paris attacks in November to cover Euro 2016.\nThe coordinated gun and bomb attacks in Paris on 13 November killed 130 people and were claimed by so-called Islamic State.\nThe Stade de France, which was targeted by suicide bombers, will host the opening match of Euro 2016 and the final.\nThe current state of emergency gives police extra powers to conduct searches and put people under house arrest.\nMore than 90,000 police, soldiers and private security agents are being deployed as well.\nUS warns of Euro 2016 terror threat",

		"InputText": "A Leave vote was always seen as more likely to generate significant disturbances in the financial world.\nFor that reason it is also the result which was thought more likely to pose a headache for the world's central banks.\nThere have already been statements from some that they are prepared to act to maintain financial stability.\nThere are two potential issues they might want to respond to in the short term: the stability of the (commercial) banks and swings in exchange rates.\nWith the banks there is a possibility of a general rise in risk aversion, and some might have difficulty borrowing in the inter-bank market. The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due.\nCentral banks can address that by lending them extra money (liquidity). In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it \"will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review\".\nOther central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it's needed.\nWhat if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs?\nThere are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank (ECB), (and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed). The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently.\nWith sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves.\nIn the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets.\nSo if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency (sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote) the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value.\nConversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency.\nFurther action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that.\nCurrency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week.  The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however.\nInterest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising; a rate rise to prevent a fall.\nBoth options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks.\nFurther quantitative easing (QE) is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon,  perhaps from the Bank of Japan (which does not want to see the yen gaining value).\nInterest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently (at 0.3%) far below the Bank's target (2%).\nAnother risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago.\nThose earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market.\nSome observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive.\nThe likely timescale for these options varies.  In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period.\nThe ECB's option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone.

		"InputText": "This was the end of the road for Wales in France but the 'Red Wall' - as Wales' players have dubbed their supporters - was still roaring its encouragement at full volume.\nWales' momentous campaign was halted by a clinical Portugal side but, watching their team play their first semi-final at a major tournament, this was no occasion for fans to feel deflated.\nThis was a moment of mutual adoration between a team who have established themselves as Wales' greatest, and their unwavering supporters.\nThe bond between Wales' players and fans has been one of the defining features of Euro 2016, a symbiotic relationship that has propelled the country's football to new heights.\nAs well as the anthem, 'Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau', and a repertoire of hymns, the Welsh chant of choice during this tournament has been 'Don't Take Me Home'.\nThere was a poignancy to its airing in Lyon, for it has been a dreamlike existence for Wales fans in France. With their team absent from major tournaments for 58 years, generations in Wales have grown up to expect failure and look on longingly as others contest World Cups and European Championships.\nBut Chris Coleman's men have changed that. The beaming smiles on Welsh fans' faces before their opening match in Bordeaux spoke of a disbelief at seeing their team finally claiming their place among international football's elite.\n\"There was a psychological barrier we needed to go through for the first one, given it had been so long,\" said Coleman.\n\"We've now sampled tournament football - such an experience, such a healthy vibe from people of all nations. We want some more of that. We need some more of that.\"\nWales' players would have been forgiven for feeling as if they were living in a bubble at their training base in the idyllic Brittany coastal town of Dinard, where a small population and a gentle pace of life meant they could take a stroll on the beach and go unnoticed.\nIt is a far cry from the frenzy their success has caused back home.\nWith every victory in France, a new fan zone seemed to spring up in Wales, from Rhyl to Aberystwyth, from Swansea to Cardiff's Principality Stadium.\nHe saw us grow up. He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him\nThe messages of support were many and varied, from David Hasselhoff to the Prince of Wales, while songs by Welsh bands the Manic Street Preachers and the Super Furry Animals gave the campaign a unique soundtrack.\nDespite their serene and remote surroundings, however, the players were aware of the impression they were making.\nIn the age of social media, athletes and their followers are closer than ever, and Wales' squad members have relished that connection.\nHal Robson-Kanu's spectacular goal against Belgium made the unattached forward one of the unlikeliest stars of Euro 2016 and, speaking a couple of days later, he laughed when told about the global reaction to his goal - including a tweet from the former Nigeria and Arsenal striker Kanu.\nThere was a similar response from Joe Allen, who laughed when this reporter informed him of a fans' banner that read: \"When God made Joe Allen, he was showing off.\"\nFrom a journalist's perspective, covering this Wales side has been a privilege, given regular and revealing access to the coaches and players.\nGareth Bale, the world's most expensive footballer, was a picture of charm and affability as he conducted his media conferences and subsequent interviews before every match. The Real Madrid forward was as comfortable talking about the Wales squad's quiz nights and their occasional treats of burgers and chips as he was about the actual football.\nFor all the lustre the likes of Bale and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey add to this Wales side, it is the unbreakable team spirit that has been the foundation of their success.\nThe vast majority of the squad have played youth football together, grown up together and become close friends.\nEven when Bale is injured, he will join up with the squad in order to see those he misses while on club duty in Spain - Joe Ledley and Wayne Hennessey are among those he gets on with best.\nThese genuine friendships have bound the team together, as has a tragedy that cast a shadow over football.\nThe death of Coleman's predecessor Gary Speed in 2011 shocked the entire sport, with the grief particularly profound for his young Wales players, many of whom are in the current side.\nCaptain Ashley Williams was clearly moved as he spoke about Speed on the eve of the match against Portugal.\n\"My thought coming in was I hope he'd be proud of us. He saw us grow up, and what we've achieved today,\" he said. \"He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him.\"\nSpeed was on the supporters' minds as well, with cries of \"There's only one Speedo\" heard at every game.\nA friend of Speed's since childhood, Coleman says he thinks about his former team-mate every day, whether there is a fixture or not.\nSucceeding his friend as Wales manager was a wrench for Coleman but there can be no doubt he and his players have done Speed proud.\nColeman said before the match against Portugal that this run to the semi-finals would not represent the end of his team's journey.\nAbsent from major tournaments for 58 years before Euro 2016, Wales are unwilling to endure another long wait.\nThe current crop of players is ripe for an era of regular qualifying, with Ashley Williams and James Collins the only players over 30 to start the match against Portugal. An average age of just over 27 means Wales' squad was the seventh youngest of the 24 teams at Euro 2016, and Coleman believes this tournament could be a springboard for further success.\n\"The one thing that will stop us from doing it again is ourselves,\" he said.\n\"We're good enough. We have to have the same hunger and desire, and we'll give the World Cup campaign a hell of a crack.\"\nWales will be back in action in September when they host Moldova in their opening qualifier for the 2018 World Cup.\nPlanning for that campaign can wait for now, though. With a homecoming parade taking place in Cardiff on Friday, Wales will take this opportunity to reflect on and revel in the magnitude of their achievement.\nJust as they were at the final whistle in Lyon, Wales' players will be greeted by the great 'Red Wall' in Cardiff.\nReturning home will feel like the end of the journey but, where Coleman and his players are concerned, this is not the final act.",

BT's retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about Â£40bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about Â£10bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap.\nSenior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off.\nSeparating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won.\nCreating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband.\nBT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company's owners.\nThis holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king.\nIt also carries an echo of the \"golden shares\" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards.\nBT's chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles.\nIf they prove too much at odds with BT's own desire to control Openreach - which it will still own - get ready for a court battle and perhaps, eventually, a full break-up.",

It shows you how careful you have to be about the context of it,\" she said.\nAsked about whether guidelines on misogynistic hate crimes would be introduced, Ms Saunders said: \"We probably need to think about it.\"\nA new law on revenge porn - someone uploading explicit images or film of a former partner to humiliate or embarrass them - has led to the prosecution of 206 people across England and Wales since its introduction in April 2015.\nThe public policy statements on hate crime will be subject to public consultation for 13 weeks.",

That cap will be for negotiation.\nEach company is expected to put together its own particular mix of heavy rail, bus and possibly light rail. The preferred contractor is expected to be known by early 2018.\nNegotiations are underway with Network Rail about handing over responsibility for the track on the core Valleys lines to the franchise holder.\nThe current franchise is run by Arriva Trains Wales which gets a subsidy from the Welsh Government of between £150m and £180m a year.\nRail privatisation laws stop the Welsh Government giving the contract to public sector bodies.\nThe Welsh Government has lobbied for more powers, but said its requests have been turned down in Westminster.\nOfficials said in time TfW may evolve to take on more responsibilities, similar to Transport for London.\nEconomy Secretary Ken Skates said new trains, quicker journeys and modernised technology were priorities for the franchise.\n\"We now have four highly skilled, experienced companies entering the next, competitive phase and I am keen to hear more from them about what they can offer Wales and how they can deliver on our plans for integrated public transport,\" he said.\n\"Over the next 10 years I envisage significant strides in the delivery of our public transport network including the electrification of the Swansea, Valleys and north Wales lines, a South and North Wales Metro and widespread structural improvements that are already in the pipeline.\"",

		"InputText": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nSince dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights, skittling well-meaning people frantically waving warning flags, and only slowing down to shout obscenities and honk his horn, the louder the better.\nBut that can happen when your mind is scrambled and you don't know what's what: you might be in the driver's seat but your hands aren't on the wheel, your feet are up on the dashboard and there's a brick on the accelerator pedal.\nAnother way of looking at it is that Fury's crash actually came on that fateful night in Germany and he has been spewing smoke ever since. The morning after the Englishman's stunning upset of Klitschko and his acquisition of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, he admitted he might struggle to cope.\nBut not even those closest to him could have anticipated how true that would prove. Having beaten the various boxing authorities to the punch and relinquished the belts before being banned, stripped or both, it's anyone's guess as to when - if ever - he'll have his keys back and his engine revving again.\nFury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years, with disarming and often alarming frankness. So his pronouncement immediately after his victory over Klitschko and the recent news that he was withdrawing from the scheduled rematch because of depression was not a shock.\nWhen I interviewed him in 2013, he described himself as \"an all-action man in anything I do. If I'm drinking, I'm drinking until I can't stand up. If I'm going out for Chinese, I'm going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If I'm eating cake, I'm eating the whole cake. I don't know what you'd call me. An idiot, maybe?\"\nHardly surprising, then, that having fulfilled his dream of winning the world heavyweight crown, Fury would lose focus. Most people having fallen down drunk or eaten a whole cake would steer clear of booze and Battenbergs for a while. But Fury is not most people.\nFury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached the pinnacle of the sport, and he certainly won't be the last. Not many people climb Everest twice.\nThe repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional\nAfter pulling off one of the greatest shocks in sporting history by beating the seemingly invincible Mike Tyson in 1990, Buster Douglas didn't train much, got fat and lost the world heavyweight crown to Evander Holyfield in his first defence. The American promptly retired, almost doubled in weight, then nearly died after falling into a diabetic coma before being struck down by depression. Same old, same old.\nJess Willard's victory over the great Jack Johnson in 1915 was almost as unbelievable as Douglas's upset of Tyson, and his reign even more shameful. Willard clearly didn't fancy fighting much, defending the world heavyweight crown once in four years before being bashed up by the great Jack Dempsey.\nSometimes depression can be triggered by a lack of motivation for the thing that defines you, sometimes that lack of motivation is triggered by depression. Either way, Fury claims he hasn't been near a gym for months and has been drinking like a fish and hoovering up cocaine instead, in a forlorn bid to mask the pain.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this month, Fury accused the British media of conducting a \"witch hunt\" against him and the British public of racism. It is important to separate the different links in Fury's sometimes rambling trains of thought.\nBefore and after his victory over Klitschko, sports writers openly discussed whether Fury should be saved from himself. Different journalists operate under different editorial guidelines, but the view of most was that they had been sent to Germany to report on a fight, not Fury's controversial outbursts.\nAs such, the repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Almost every boxing writer proclaimed Fury's performance as one of the finest ever by a British fighter, and they were right.\nBut the problem with a siege mentality is that you forget what's happening beyond the castle walls, who your real friends are, and paranoia sets in.\nWhen Fury threatened violence against a journalist and later took aim at bisexual, transsexual and Jewish people, it was internet vloggers - to whom he had granted intimate access - who provided the platform. The so-called mainstream media (newspapers and major broadcasters) had been frozen out, ironically because they had dared to report what he had told those same vloggers.\nFury's camp would do well to memorise a quote attributed to George Orwell: \"Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printing. Everything else is public relations.\" How many times has Fury been saved by journalistic self-censorship?\nIn threatening that journalist, the Mail on Sunday's Oliver Holt, for reporting that he had compared homosexuality to paedophilia, Fury betrayed his sense of entitlement - not only because of his feats in the ring, but because of his religious convictions. If it's in the Bible, how dare anyone question his beliefs?\nIf you make questionable statements about gay people or Jews or women, the media will come down on you, whether you are a fine boxer, a deeply religious man, a nice bloke really, none of the above or all of them. Fury's Traveller heritage doesn't come into it, as least as far as most of the media is concerned.\n\"I know Tyson personally and he's a really nice guy,\" says Ricky Hatton, Fury's fellow Mancunian and another boxer who has struggled with depression. \"But sometimes he puts his mouth into gear before his brain and when someone puts a camera in front of him he feels he has to say something outrageous.\"\nFury fans frequently claim that Anthony Joshua is given preferential treatment by the media, but this is because the IBF heavyweight champion - Fury was stripped of that belt shortly after winning it because he would not face the federation's mandatory challenger - largely conducts himself like a gentleman. As for Joshua's brushes with the law, they have been covered at length in the media and he has clearly learnt from them.\nHowever, some of the racial abuse Fury receives on social media is despicable.\nWhen you are called every name under the sun on a daily basis, it is likely to have an effect on your mental wellbeing. No wonder, as Fury also stated in his interview with Rolling Stone, that he feels like everyone is out to get him.\nOn Wednesday, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) met to discuss what should be done with Fury, and has suspended his licence, pending a meeting with him. It could hardly do otherwise. It did the same to Hatton in 2010, also following allegations of cocaine use, and, as the BBBofC's general secretary Robert Smith has pointed out, \"cocaine is against the law of the land\".\nThere was also Fury's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and a subsequent ban to consider (Fury has an appeal hearing scheduled in November), as well as the allegation that he refused to take a drugs test (a misdemeanour that can lead to a four-year ban) and the argument that a man with severe mental health issues shouldn't be anywhere near a boxing ring.\nIt should also be remembered that the BBBofC has already fined Fury twice for misconduct and that it has boxing's image to think about - as mad as that sounds.\nEven if Fury hadn't voluntarily given up his belts, the WBA and WBO would have stripped him of them.\nIt might seem callous, but the sanctioning bodies are businesses, the heavyweight belts are their biggest money-spinners and it is only fair that other boxers should be allowed to fight for them. It makes no difference whether a boxer has meningitis, a broken leg or mental health issues, the sport must move on. As WBO chief Jose Izquierdo put it: \"We can't have a belt held hostage.\"\nOne can only hope that, during his absence from the ring, Fury gets the help he so desperately needs and returns fitter and more focused.\n\"Being someone who lives by the seat of his pants and for the moment, this could be the end of him,\" was Hatton's grim assessment. \"He doesn't like boxing and finds the training hard. It's not looking good.\n\"But I was in a dark place, didn't care if I lived or died. I did very well in boxing but near enough everything wrong in life. The only way I got out of it was by asking for help. I fought through it and I hope Tyson can do the same.\"\nFingers crossed that Fury will be remembered for that fine performance against Klitschko in Dusseldorf - and for many fine performances in the future - rather than as a wreck, spewing smoke on the side of the road as bright lights flash by.",

Taxiways and aprons - where aircraft park - have also been sabotaged.\nAbout 50,000 Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition airstrikes, are currently involved in a military offensive to reclaim Mosul from IS militants.\nGovernment forces have already retaken dozens of villages and towns surrounding the city and are currently consolidating gains made in Mosul's eastern outskirts.\nThe damage to the runways has rendered the airport worthless as an asset for attacking forces, says Stratfor. Airports or runways are typically a primary objective for assaults on cities, since control over them can deny or enable logistical capabilities, having a considerable impact on the outcome of battles.\nHowever, IS militants have ensured there is little left for approaching forces to gain by taking the site, Stratfor says.\nIS employed a similar tactic at Qayyarah air base, 70km (43 miles) south of Mosul. However, the trenches dug there only partially covered the main runway, Stratfor says, and it was restored to service within months of the Iraqi forces recapturing the base in July.\nBy comparison, Mosul airport's destruction could be much more difficult to repair.\nMirroring the demolition at Qayyarah, IS fighters have also levelled almost every structure at Mosul airport.\nStratfor says that as well as preventing Iraqi forces and their allies from using the facilities, the tactic also serves to clear the line of sight for IS defensive positions on the northern edge of the airport.\nAlong with restoring the runways, Iraqi forces would need to rebuild hangars, warehouses and other infrastructure in order to use it as a logistical base.\nIn contrast to the widespread destruction elsewhere in the area, the images show how the city's sugar factory remains relatively intact - testimony to its utility to IS.\nAfter the jihadists captured Mosul in June 2014, they continued to operate the factory, says Stratfor, and more than a year later, executed the plant's manager when she refused to run it for them.\nHowever, the images also show how coalition airstrikes, aimed at destroying key IS positions and assets, have caused some damage to the buildings.\nSatellite imagery released last week, showed how IS had constructed multiple barricades across key routes into the northern Iraqi city.",

We are all DoE scientists in that regard,\" said Dr Kevin Trenberth who has been a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).\n\"That is a pretty chilling action by an incoming administration - the rhetoric suggests that revenge is a valid response to people who disagree with you,\" said Prof Robert Paterson,\nThe Energy department has refused to comply with the request and the Trump team has now said the questionnaire was \"not authorised\".\nMany researchers are worried that the anti-climate tone being struck by the incoming administration will have many serious consequences for scientists trying to do their jobs in real world situations.\n\"Flooding is a fact of life in Texas and the frequency with which we're seeing it is noticeably increasing,\" said Dr Shannon Van Zandt, at Texas A&M University.\n\"A lot of the tools that have been developed by Federal agencies have been designed to help communities predict the changes that they're going to see and if that is restricted we would lose the ability to help people understand and incorporate it into the decisions that they're making both at the local level and at the state policy level.\"\nBut some in this field believe that the change of administration is a good moment to review the type of scientific questions that US researchers are asking.\nMarcel Crok is a Dutch science writer who doesn't support the scientific consensus on climate change. He says that much of the research in the field takes place in an echo chamber and he welcomes the fact that the Trump administration will challenge this.\nMr Crok accepts that human emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the planet, but he questions the accepted view on how far and how rapidly temperatures will rise. Mainstream scientists, he says, rely on models that are over sensitive to carbon. He expects this to change under Trump.\nHe said: \"What the field is trying to do is prove that the observational estimates are wrong and that the models are still right, and in my opinion this is exactly the problem. They should be more open minded, they should be open to the idea that the models are wrong!\"\n\"I hope that under a Trump regime at least there would be more funding, because if the funding agencies ask these kind of questions they can stimulate research in other directions than proving that the models are right all the time.\"\nThe idea that aspects of climate research, supported by a minority, should now gain funding at the expense of the majority view, is dismissed by those in the field.\n\"It is not all spun, it is not all one side or the other,\" said Prof James White from the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado.\n\"This is good unbiased information, it would be a real shame if that data is turned off.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook",

We think that such decisions of the acting administration, which is supposed to be in office for three more weeks, pursue two aims: finally (irrevocably?) spoiling US-Russian relations and, obviously, having an impact on the foreign policy of the future administration of the president-elect [Donald Trump].\"\n\"What these individuals were doing were basically collecting intelligence. They were intelligence officers operating here and using these compounds, one in New York, one in Maryland, for intelligence collection purposes.

I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM!

Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds.\nColdplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce.\nShe only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement.\nSome of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier.\nThe performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.\nYou can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX.\nShe raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic.\nFor the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers.\n1987's show was altogether more bizarre.\nA magician named \"Elvis Presto\" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics.\nAt the culmination of the show, the \"Prince of Prestidigitation\" performed an interactive magic trick (\"pick a card, concentrate real hard\") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses.\nIt was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach.\nShe arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous \"left shark\".\nHe was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves.\nIt quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star.\nAnd when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend.\nPoor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob.\nFew ever believed that the \"wardrobe malfunction\" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press).\nNonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered.\nBut there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online.\nIn response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content.

France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer.\nIt is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is.\n\"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor.\nBut there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry.\nGordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user.\n\"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them.\n\"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds.\nIf the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry.\nIt will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica.\nOne long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors.\n\"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues.\nIn his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up.\n\"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds.\nUnless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by.\nBut if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor.\nJust a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses.\nWhen it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market.\nFor its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace.\nIn 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses.\nThe overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories.\nMarket research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\".\nEven so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (Â£12.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review.\nThese are:\nAn inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers.\nA Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal.\n\"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said.\n\"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added.\nThe EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules.\nBut the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution.\n\"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says.\n\"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\"\nIf you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds.\nOf course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers.\nOpticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit.\nThey also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising.\nBut for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business.\nOn worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.\nFor the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros.\nWith cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further.\nWill customers benefit as well?",

The latest findings help to explain why.\nHowever, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet.\nHe told the BBC: \"It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise.\"\nHe said people could \"get into trouble\" with their health if it was done without medical guidance.\nDr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: \"This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we'll know more about what it means for people with diabetes.\n\"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\"\nFollow James on Twitter.",

I don't think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race.\n\"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities.\n\"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative.\n\"Medals at any cost, that's how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012.\"\nHouvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age.\n\"I can certainly relate to the bullying,\" she said. \"For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn't seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012.\n\"They didn't care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them.\n\"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don't feel was right.\"\nFourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying.\nAsked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: \"It's a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals.\n\"It's not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through.\n\"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they'll be dealt with.\"",

The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons.\nA few hours later, Faizan lay dead near a sun-baked school playground, ringed by bare walnut and willow trees. Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head.\nCarrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election.\nEyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front.\nFaizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital.\n\"I knew he was gone,\" Zarifa told me.\nA heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead.\nFaizan's final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video: his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest \"martyr\". By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan.\nFaizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day.\nThe voter turnout in Sunday's election was an abysmal 7.1% - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region's mainstream parties.\nThe soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with \"protests and provocation\" in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me.\nOne report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds.\nSeparatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the \"anti-people\" agenda of the Indian government.\nDisillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away.\nWhy Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear.\nBy all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire.\nWhatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir's unending tragedy.\nA picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - \"he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world,\" the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera.\n\"He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted [former Indian captain] MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor,\" a cousin told me, when I visited the family.\nGrief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa's lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn.\n\"My son, my son, where will I find you now?\" she cried, again and again.\nThen she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls. The room had a red carpet and red window curtains.\n\"The blood of a martyr never goes waste,\" said Fayaz Ahmad Dar. \"One day, the blood of innocents will help us gain our freedom [from Indian rule].\"\nA brief silence followed. Zarifa broke it, bemoaning the loss of her boy.\n\"I am looking at your books, I am looking at your school bags. How will I touch your books again, my son? Everybody would talk about your intelligence, how you would answer every question with so much wit.\"\nOutside the secondary school - Enter to learn, Leave to serve, its motto, is engraved on the walls - a group of young men gathered later in the day. Their eyes seethed in anger. They spoke about frustration, alienation, desperation, humiliation and hopelessness.\nThey said they had lost their fear of life. They insisted that they helped rebels because \"they are our brothers and don't kill civilians\" and are \"fighting for freedom\".\nMore than half of them raised their hands when asked whether they had pelted stones at Indian forces.\n\"We are not safe in our own homes, we are not safe on streets. They are killing little boys now. Life is uncertain,\" said Feroze Ali, a school clerk.\nSince February alone, some two dozen civilians have been killed during gunfights between armed rebels and security forces. The security forces have accused civilians of helping rebels escape.\nThe army says it has tried to reach out and engage with civilians through its 29 schools, youth clubs and cricket tournaments.\nRecently some 19,000 Kashmiri young men applied for a few hundred vacancies in the army.\n\"Provocation and panic can lead to accidents. Security forces often fire when they face life threatening situations. But protecting civilians remains our first priority in this situation. When a civilian dies, it hurts us,\" an army officer told me.\nThe region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. More than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes with protesters during a four-month-long lockdown, including a 55-day-curfew, in the restive Muslim-majority valley.\nKashmir, clearly, appears to be teetering on the brink of an open public revolt against Indian rule.\nMany say the federal government's near-complete lack of engagement and dialogue with local stakeholders and Pakistan, a complete mistrust of the local government and a lack of development and jobs have left most people jittery and alienated.\nMilitancy continues to be at low ebb - there are an estimated 250 militants in the state now of which 150 are local - compared to several thousand during the peak of insurgency in the 1990s.\nBut young Kashmiris - more than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30, and more than 40% of men in Kashmir are jobless - are restless and angry. The local political parties are in danger of \"becoming irrelevant\", as a leader of an opposition party told me.\n\"This is the worst situation that I have seen. Earlier, it was a movement led by the militants. Now it is being led by the people,\" says Feroze Ali, 35, a schoolteacher.\n\"India needs to be worried, very worried about this.\"",

This was my dream. When the final decision was taken I didn't believe it. But unfortunately, this is the reality.\"\n\"I think it's a stupid reaction,\" Russian MP Vitaly Milonov tells me. \"They're even afraid of such a small girl to enter Kiev.\"\nEven before Ukraine's ban, Mr Milonov had called for a Russian boycott of Eurovision: \"Eurovision became a disgusting socialist nightmare for all these left-wing parties with all their bearded women, or men, with these anti-Christian positions.\n\"I am sure that most conservatives in the world will never attend this festival. Because this is a festival of Sodom and Gomorrah.\"\nIt is supposed to be a festival of peace and friendship but there is not much sign of either in relations between Kiev and Moscow.\nIn eastern Ukraine, 10,000 people have been killed in three years of war: a war in which Russia is directly involved through its military support for separatist rebels. Crimea remains a source of tension and Eurovision is the latest battleground.\n\"Since 2014, we've had a law in Ukraine that punishes people who illegally cross our border when they visit Crimea,\" says Ukrainian MP Olha Chervakova.\n\"Did Russia know this? Of course. Did Russia know that Julia Samoilova would fall foul of this law? Of course. In other words, entering her in the contest was a conscious provocation to create a huge political scandal.\"\nThe ban created a huge headache for Eurovision organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\nEurovision's Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand said in March that Ukraine's decision went \"against both the spirit of the contest and the notion of inclusivity that lies at the heart of its values\".\nIn an unprecedented move, the EBU offered Russia the chance to take part by satellite from Moscow.\nRussia declined: after the dramas of last year's Eurovision, Moscow was in no mood to compromise.\nUkraine's 2016 winning entry, 1944, sung by Jamala, was about Joseph Stalin's deportation of Crimea's Tatar population.\nRussia had argued that Jamala's song broke contest rules for being of a political nature. When it won, Moscow cried foul and said there was politics at play. Now Russia seems determined to make not only Ukraine look bad, but the entire Eurovision Song Contest.\nWhen strangers are coming, they come to your house, they kill you and say 'we're not guilty'\nRecently, two Russian pranksters - posing as Ukraine's prime minister and his assistant - released online a telephone conversation they had recorded with a woman they claimed was EBU Director General Ingrid Deltenre.\nIf this is the voice of the EBU's top official, it is hugely embarrassing for the EBU, because the woman on the recording makes an astonishing admission about Ukraine's winning song: \"I was just too late made aware of the song.\n\"If I would have been earlier, and I think it was on purpose, I would have not allowed the song to participate, to be very transparent.\"\nIn a statement, the EBU said it would \"not comment on prank calls\".\nBut these are high-profile Russian pranksters, who once fooled Elton John into thinking he was talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"Now our people don't trust Eurovision any more,\" one of the pranksters, Alexei, told me. \"People understand that any country can use their political goals to win, so it's not a fair contest anymore.\"\nPerhaps this is not just about a song contest? Or Russia's relations with Ukraine?\nEquating Eurovision with Sodom and Gomorrah and embarrassing the EBU appear part of a wider pattern of Russia trying to undermine Western institutions and Western liberal ideas.\n\"Russia now defines itself in its social and societal model against the West,\" believes Jan Techau of the Richard Holbrooke Forum at the American Academy in Berlin. \"The Kremlin explicitly portrays Russian society as a counter model to the corrupted West. They seem now to buy completely into the idea that whatever harms the West is good for Russia: a classic zero-sum game.\"\nIn the run-up to this year's contest, singer Jamala warned that \"we should expect more provocations [from Russia] because our victory hurt them a lot.\"\nSecurity in Kiev is tight ahead of the first semi-final.\nAs for Julia Samoilova, instead of singing at Eurovision this week, she will be performing - once again - in Crimea.

There are no fees for Scottish students in Scotland and the Institute for Fiscal Studies says scrapping the lower fees charged in Northern Ireland and Wales would cost a further £500m per year.\nThis would be covered by the £48.6bn that Labour's manifesto says will be raised by tax changes - along with the party's other spending commitments.\nBut there are lower estimates.\nLabour's figure is based on replacing the fees currently paid by students.\nBut the IFS and London Economics say the cost to the Treasury could be lower, when written off loans are taken into account, with forecasts around £7.5bn to £8bn.\nLabour's big move on fees represents a complete of direction. Previously in government, Labour raised fees and in opposition proposed a modest reduction.\nBut they are now proposing to bulldoze the apparatus of fees, loans and repayments.\nThe most recent figures show £76bn is owed in student loans in England - with this level of student debt having almost doubled in four years.\nFrom this autumn, fees will begin increasing every year with inflation and will soon glide past the £10,000 mark, with interest charges also rising to 6.1%.\nAnd the Conservative government, before the election, had announced plans to sell off student debt to private investors.\nUnder Labour's plans, this whole push towards marketisation would be ditched - and universities would return to being directly funded by government.\nBut is there any evidence that getting rid of fees would help more young people into university, including the disadvantaged?\nUniversities are worried that such a switch to direct funding, dependent on government finances, would put a limit on places and a brake on expansion.\nOne of the quiet revolutions of recent years has been the complete removal of limits on student numbers - with universities able to recruit as many students as they can accommodate - and opening the door to rising numbers of graduates.\nThe argument for fees has always been that they provide the funding to allow more young people to go to university - and that a much smaller proportion went to university when there were no fees.\nThis year has seen a fall of 5% in university applications from UK students - and it follows a pattern of dips when fees are increased.\nBut the long-term trend has been relentlessly upwards, with a huge growth in demand for university places. It remains a powerful symbol of family aspiration.\nAlthough wealthy families remain much more likely to send their children to university - entry rates have risen across all social classes, including the poorest.\nDo students get value for money from tuition fees? Is this an investment that is repaid in better job prospects?\nDepartment for Education figures published last month showed that graduates remained more likely to be in a job than non-graduates and on average earned £10,000 per year more.\nAmong younger people, this graduate advantage is less, at £6,000 per year.\nBut the figures also showed that, despite rises in fees, graduate salaries have stagnated over the past decade.\nLabour's plan sends a strong political signal to young voters.\nA survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute, taken before the manifesto publication, suggested that Labour is now more popular among students than it was in any of the three previous general elections.\nThe survey found Labour significantly ahead in the student vote.\nThe Liberal Democrats, once the most popular party for students, are trailing in third behind the Conservatives.\nIs this still the cloud of tuition fees hanging over the Lib Dems from their U-turn during the coalition government?\nCould they really entirely scrap fees?\nThere will be plenty of scrutiny over funding Labour's plans. But there is nothing unprecedented or outlandish about getting rid of fees.\nGermany has phased out tuition fees - and universities in the Netherlands and Scandinavia try to recruit students from England with the offer of low or no fees.\nFrench undergraduates can study for low fees.\nIn the United States, New York state is introducing free fees for students from families earning up to about £100,000 per year, offering a handout to the squeezed middle classes.\nThere are now leading universities in the US which have lower tuition fees than in England. The University of Washington charges less than the University of Wolverhampton.\nAnd the most immediate example of getting rid of fees has been in Scotland.\nFor England's voters, Labour's undiluted policy on tuition fees - proposing their complete abolition - offers the sharpest divide in the road for decades.",

She developed an extreme fear of death, and this can precipitate her panic attacks.\nDuring an attack, Emma feels terrified, and can often scream out loud.\nIt is extremely worrying for her family and can be scary to onlookers.\nEmma has tried various medications and counselling therapies but was still struggling and getting three to four panic attacks per day.\nOne of the ways in which I helped her was by changing her food choices.\nDespite being sceptical at first, I was able to show Emma the hidden power of food in helping her mental state.\n\"I had been living on a diet of takeaways, fizzy drinks and general processed and convenience foods for as long as I can remember, and didn't for one moment think that what I ate was contributing in any way to the anxiety and panic attacks I'd been experiencing for years,\" she said.\n\"Since meeting and spending time with Dr Rangan, he has changed my entire outlook on food, and why certain foods were potentially having a negative impact on my mental health.\n\"I now only buy and cook with fresh food, I make my own stocks, I eat plenty of fish and I try to reduce the amount of sugar I consume.\n\"I feel so much better and intend to keep this up.\"\nThe evidence of food's link to mental states has been growing.\nA landmark 2015 article in the prestigious Lancet journal stated that nutrition may be as important to mental health as it is to cardiology, endocrinology and gastroenterology.\nPlus, a small but important interventional Australian study from earlier this year showed that a modified Mediterranean diet significantly helped many patients with severe depression within 12 weeks.\nUnfortunately, this has not translated into routine patient care and most doctors still do not discuss food with their mental health patients.\nThis has to change.\nMany of us do not think about how food can impact the way we feel, but we all know the feeling of using food as a quick pick-me-up.\nWhen we are feeling a little tired, a little stressed or a little low, we often reach for a sugary snack to help us feel good in the short term.\nBut, this can actually make things worse in the long term.\nThe food you are eating is literally \"shocking\" your body.\nBy changing her diet, as well as reducing her alcohol intake, Emma experienced a reduction in anxiety, an improvement in mood and fewer panic attacks.\nShe also described feeling mentally stronger, having a clearer head, more energy and a greater ability to cope with stress.\nIt has also encouraged her to be more active and do more things at weekends, which also helps her mental health.\nOf course, there can be many other factors to consider with mental health problems and it is always worth getting advice from a qualified healthcare professional.\nThere can be many other important factors to consider with mental health problems, such as emotional trauma and stress, but we should not underestimate the power of changing our food to improve our mood.\nAs a doctor, I like to empower my patients. Here are four of the tips that helped Emma, that can also help you:\n1. Reduce sugar and processed foods\nSugar, food that contains sugar, or even food that is converted quickly into sugar, such as many breakfast cereals, cause your blood sugar to rapidly rise.\nWithin two to three hours your sugar levels then start to fall.\nAt this point, you may not only feel hungry, you can feel \"h-angry\" as well - hungry and angry.\nLow and falling blood sugar levels can cause a rise in your body's stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline.\nThis can have a negative impact on your mood.\n2. Increase your intake of Omega-3 fats\nThis is an essential nutrient for brain function and may protect against anxiety and other psychiatric disorders.\nFoods high in Omega-3 fats include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, anchovies), grass-fed meat, seeds and leafy vegetables.\n3. Eat more tryptophan-containing foods like pork, chicken, seeds and walnuts\nTryptophan is an amino acid the body converts into serotonin, your feel-good neurotransmitter.\nEat them with a healthy carbohydrate source such as sweet potatoes, which helps to transport more tryptophan into your blood.\n4. Feed your gut bugs\nSome scientists refer to the trillions of gut bugs that live inside us, the gut microbiota, as the brain's peacekeepers.\nIt is thought that having a healthy population of gut bugs can have a significant influence on your mood via the gut-brain axis.\nThe prebiotic fibre contained in vegetables help your gut bugs to proliferate, so the best way to maintain a healthy population is to increase your intake of vegetables, as well as fermented foods such as sauerkraut.\nBest options are leeks, onions, garlic, artichokes and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower.\nYou have the ability to improve the way you feel by controlling what you put on your plate.\nSee how food can impact mental health on Doctor in the House, Monday, 21:00 BST on BBC One.",

		"InputText": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nOf his first 30 matches in 2017, the world number one has won 21 and lost nine.\nWinning his last five tournaments of 2016 to pip Novak Djokovic to the year-end number one position in the final match of the season at London's O2 Arena was astonishing, dramatic and unforgettable.\nAnd yet it appears that relentless run of success, and the 87 matches he played over a season, has come at a price.\nMurray's straight-set defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queen's Club was the sixth time he has lost to a player outside the top 20 this year. He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern.\nOpting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer?\nAlthough it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMurray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets.\nAs well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells.\nThough he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open.\nSo, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon.\nMurray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final.\nIt would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years.\nYet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field.\nHe has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way.\nThis year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%.\nHe claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden.\nBut perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter.\nThat may not be a concern much longer.\nMurray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest.\nIn fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further.\nNadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further.\nAnd then there's Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device",
